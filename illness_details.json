        "Overview": "Achalasia is a swallowing condition that affects the tube connecting the mouth and the stomach, called the esophagus. Damaged nerves make it hard for the muscles of the esophagus to squeeze food and liquid into the stomach. Food then collects in the esophagus, sometimes fermenting and washing back up into the mouth. This fermented food can taste bitter. Achalasia is a fairly rare condition. Some people mistake it for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, in achalasia, the food is coming from the esophagus. In GERD, the material comes from the stomach. There's no cure for achalasia. Once the esophagus is damaged, the muscles cannot work properly again. But symptoms can usually be managed with endoscopy, minimally invasive therapy or surgery.",

A small gland in the brain called the pituitary gland drives these changes by making too much growth hormone. This usually happens due to a tumor of the pituitary gland. The tumor isn't cancer. When the body has too much growth hormone, bones get bigger. In childhood, this leads to increased height as part of a condition called gigantism. In adults with acromegaly, a change in height doesn't happen. Instead, bones in the hands, feet and face become bigger. These changes happen slowly over many years. So people with acromegaly and their loved ones may take a long time to notice the symptoms. And healthcare professionals may have a hard time finding and treating the condition early on. Without treatment, acromegaly can lead to other serious and sometimes life-threatening health conditions called complications.

Acute liver failure, also known as fulminant hepatic failure, can cause serious complications, including bleeding and increased pressure in the brain. It's a medical emergency that requires hospitalization. Depending on the cause, acute liver failure can sometimes be reversed with treatment.

Although small, these glands control much of what happens in the body. They make hormones that help control metabolism, blood pressure and other important functions. Adrenal cancer is rare, and it can happen at any age. It's most likely to affect children younger than 5 and adults in their 40s and 50s. Adrenal cancer also is called adrenocortical carcinoma. When adrenal cancer is found early, a cure may be possible. When the cancer has spread beyond the adrenal glands, a cure becomes less likely.

        "Overview": "Agoraphobia (ag-uh-ruh-FOE-be-uh) is a type of anxiety disorder. Agoraphobia involves fearing and avoiding places or situations that might cause panic and feelings of being trapped, helpless or embarrassed. You may fear an actual or upcoming situation. For example, you may fear using public transportation, being in open or enclosed spaces, standing in line, or being in a crowd. The anxiety is caused by fear that there's no easy way to escape or get help if the anxiety gets overwhelming. You may avoid situations because of fears such as getting lost, falling, or having diarrhea and not being able to get to a bathroom. Most people who have agoraphobia develop it after having one or more panic attacks, causing them to worry about having another attack. They then avoid the places where it may happen again. Agoraphobia often results in having a hard time feeling safe in any public place, especially where crowds gather and in locations that are not familiar. You may feel that you need a companion, such as a family member or friend, to go with you to public places. The fear can be so overwhelming that you may feel you can't leave your home. Agoraphobia treatment can be challenging because it means confronting your fears. But with proper treatment — usually a form of therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy and medicines — you can escape the trap of agoraphobia and live a more enjoyable life.",

Melanin also plays a role in the development and function of the eyes, so people with albinism have vision problems. Symptoms of albinism are usually seen in a person's skin, hair and eye color, but sometimes differences are slight. People with albinism are also sensitive to the effects of the sun, so they're at higher risk of getting skin cancer.

Experts increasingly refer to this condition as alcohol-associated hepatitis, a term meant to reduce stigma and emphasize the medical nature of the disease. Alcoholic hepatitis is a serious form of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). ALD includes several types of liver conditions caused by alcohol, from fat deposits in the liver to severe liver scarring, calledcirrhosis. Not everyone who drinks heavily will develop liver disease, but it is common. Studies show that up to 1 in 3 people withalcohol use disorderwill develop some kind of ARLD. Stopping alcohol use is the most important step in treating alcoholic hepatitis along with focusing on nutrition. Continuing to drink alcohol after being diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis greatly increases the risk of liver failure and death.",

        "Overview": "Allergies happen when the immune system reacts to a foreign substance that gets inside the body. These substances are known as allergens. They include pollen, bee venom and pet dander. Allergies also can happen due to certain foods and medicines that don't cause reactions in most people. The immune system makes protective proteins called antibodies that attack invaders such as germs. But with allergies, the immune system makes antibodies that mark a specific allergen as harmful, even though it isn't. Coming into contact with the allergen causes an immune system reaction that can inflame the skin, sinuses, airways or digestive system. Allergic reactions vary from person to person. They can range from minor irritation to a life-threatening emergency called anaphylaxis. While most allergies can't be cured, treatments can help relieve your allergy symptoms.",

        "Overview": "Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a condition that's passed through families, called inherited. It can cause damage to the lungs, liver, skin and blood vessels. Not everyone who has AATD develops symptoms or health concerns. People in the same family may have different symptoms. Genes control how every cell in the body works. Some genes decide basic traits, such as eye color or hair color. Other genes can increase the risk of getting certain diseases, including AATD. One gene tells the liver to make alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT or A1AT) protein. This protein travels through the bloodstream to protect the lungs from smoke, pollution, fumes or dust that is breathed in. But in people who have AATD, gene changes cause the liver to either not make enough AAT protein or make protein that isn't formed correctly. These gene changes also are called variants. Researchers have found more than 120 variants that are linked to AATD. In the lungs, a lack of AAT protein can lead to emphysema or ongoing bronchitis. These are forms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The lack of protein also can lead to bronchiectasis. In the liver, AATD that builds up can cause fibrosis and cirrhosis. AATD also can increase the risk of liver cancer. AATD has no cure. But with early diagnosis and the right care, many people with AATD can prevent serious problems or control symptoms and improve their quality of life. Some people who have never smoked may live a typical lifespan. However, they may still develop lung disease, liver disease or both.",

Alpha-gal syndrome can be life-threatening. In the United States, the condition most often begins with the bite of the lone star tick. Other types of ticks cause the condition in different parts of the world, mainly in parts of Europe, Australia, Asia, South Africa, and South and Central America. Alpha-gal syndrome causes mild to intense allergies to red meat, such as beef, pork or lamb. It also can cause reactions to other foods that come from mammals, such as dairy products or gelatin. Some people may have alpha-gal syndrome and not know it. There are people who have serious allergic reactions, called anaphylactic reactions, for no known reason. Because the reactions can be delayed for hours, researchers think that some of these people may be affected by alpha-gal syndrome. The only treatment for alpha-gal syndrome is to not eat red meat or other products from mammals that can trigger reactions. A serious allergic reaction may need medicine called epinephrine and treatment in an emergency room.",

        "Overview": "Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. Alzheimer's disease is the biological process that begins with the appearance of a buildup of proteins in the form of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. This causes brain cells to die over time and the brain to shrink. About 6.9 million people in the United States age 65 and older live with Alzheimer's disease. Among them, more than 70% are age 75 and older. Of the more than 55 million people in the world with dementia, 60% to 70% are estimated to have Alzheimer's disease. Early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease include forgetting recent events or conversations. Over time, Alzheimer's disease leads to serious memory loss and affects a person's ability to do everyday tasks. There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease. In advanced stages, loss of brain function can cause dehydration, poor nutrition or infection. These complications can result in death. But medicines may improve symptoms or slow the decline in thinking. Programs and services can help support people with the disease and their caregivers.",

Common causes of an anal fissure include constipation and straining or passing hard or large stools during a bowel movement. Anal fissures typically cause pain and bleeding with bowel movements. You also may experience spasms in the ring of muscle at the end of your anus, called the anal sphincter. Anal fissures are very common in young infants but can affect people of any age. Most anal fissures get better with simple treatments, such as eating more fiber or soaking in a warm-water bath. Some people with anal fissures may need medicine. Sometimes, surgery may be necessary.",

        "Overview": "Anorexia (an-o-REK-see-uh) nervosa, often simply called anorexia, is a treatable eating disorder in which people have a low body weight based on personal weight history. Although many people with anorexia look very thin, some may not look thin and others may look overweight. But they've actually lost weight or failed to gain needed weight. People who have anorexia often have a strong fear of gaining weight and may think they're overweight, even when they're thin. To prevent weight gain or continue to lose weight, people with anorexia often limit the amount or type of food they eat. They place a high value on controlling their weight and shape and use extreme efforts that can greatly harm their lives. Anorexia can cause changes in the brain due to very poor nutrition, also called malnutrition. This is when people don't get the nutrients that their bodies need to stay healthy. So it's not a choice to continue the risky and damaging behavior. If left untreated, weight loss can get to a point where people with anorexia are at high risk of serious physical harm or death. Anorexia has the second-highest death rate of any mental illness, surpassed only by opioid overdoses. Most deaths related to anorexia stem from heart conditions and suicide. Anorexia, like other eating disorders, can take over people's lives and be very hard to overcome. Because it's related to changes in the brain, anorexia behaviors are not choices, and the illness is not really about food or looking a certain way. With proven treatment, people with anorexia can return to a healthy weight, develop more-balanced eating habits, and reverse some of anorexia's serious medical and mental health complications.",

This can happen with aging, during vaginal childbirth, or with ongoing constipation, hard coughing or heavy lifting. Treatments for anterior prolapse include watchful waiting, devices that hold the organs in place, called pessaries, and exercises to strengthen pelvic floor muscles. Some people have surgery.",

        "Overview": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs when lung swelling causes fluid to build up in the tiny elastic air sacs in the lungs. These air sacs, called alveoli, have a protective membrane, but lung swelling damages that membrane. The fluid leaking into the air sacs keeps the lungs from filling with enough air. This means less oxygen reaches the bloodstream, so the body's organs don't get the oxygen they need to work properly. ARDS usually occurs in people who are already critically ill or have major injuries. People usually are severely short of breath — the main symptom of ARDS — within a few hours to a few days after the injury or infection that caused ARDS. Many people who get ARDS don't survive. The risk of death gets higher with age and how severe the illness is. Of the people who survive ARDS, some fully recover. But others have lasting lung damage.",

Arteriosclerosishappens when the blood vessels that carry oxygen and nutrients from the heart to the rest of the body become thick and stiff. These blood vessels are called arteries. Healthy arteries are flexible and elastic. But over time, the walls in the arteries can harden, a condition commonly called hardening of the arteries. Atherosclerosisis a specific type of arteriosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is the buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on the artery walls. This buildup is called plaque. The plaque can cause arteries to narrow, blocking blood flow. The plaque also can burst, leading to a blood clot. Although atherosclerosis is often considered a heart condition, it can affect arteries anywhere in the body. Atherosclerosis can be treated. Healthy lifestyle habits can help prevent atherosclerosis.",

        "Overview": "An arteriovenous malformation, also known as an AVM, is a tangle of blood vessels that creates irregular connections between arteries and veins. This disrupts blood flow and prevents tissues from receiving oxygen. AnAVMcan occur anywhere in the body, including in the brain. Arteries move oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the brain and other organs. Veins drain the oxygen-depleted blood back to the lungs and heart. When anAVMdisrupts this critical process, surrounding tissues might not get enough oxygen. Because the tangled blood vessels in anAVMdo not form properly, they can weaken and burst. If anAVMin the brain bursts, it can cause bleeding in the brain, which can lead to a stroke or brain damage. Bleeding in the brain is known as a hemorrhage. Read more aboutbrain AVM (arteriovenous malformation). The cause ofAVMsis not clear. Rarely, they are passed down in families. Once diagnosed, a brainAVMoften can be treated to prevent or reduce the risk of complications.",

The most common types of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis causes cartilage — the hard, slippery tissue that covers the ends of bones where they form a joint — to break down. Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease in which the immune system attacks the joints, beginning with the lining of joints. Uric acid crystals, which form when there's too much uric acid in your blood, can cause gout. Infections or underlying disease, such as psoriasis or lupus, can cause other types of arthritis. Treatments vary depending on the type of arthritis. The main goals of arthritis treatments are to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life.",

Symptoms of asthma attack include coughing, wheezing, tightness in the chest and difficulty getting enough air. These symptoms happen because muscles around airways tighten up, the airways become irritated and swollen, and the lining of the airways produces a fluid called mucus. All of these factors make it difficult to breathe. People who already have a diagnosis of asthma usually have an asthma action plan. This tells them what medicines to take if they have an asthma attack and when to get emergency care. People who do not have a diagnosis or don't have a treatment plan should get emergency care if they have these symptoms. Frequent asthma attacks show that a person's asthma is not under control. A healthcare professional might make changes in medicines and the asthma action plan to improve control. An asthma attack also is called an asthma exacerbation or asthma flare-up.",

Ataxia usually results from damage to the part of the brain called the cerebellum or its connections. The cerebellum controls muscle coordination. Many conditions can cause ataxia, including genetic conditions, stroke, tumors, multiple sclerosis, degenerative diseases and alcohol misuse. Certain medicines also can cause ataxia. Treatment for ataxia depends on the cause. Devices such as walkers and canes might help maintain independence. These also are called adaptive devices. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and regular exercise also might help.",

Atelectasis is one of the most common breathing complications after surgery. It's also a possible complication of other respiratory problems, including cystic fibrosis, lung tumors, chest injuries, fluid in the lung and respiratory weakness. You may develop atelectasis if you breathe in a foreign object. This condition can make breathing hard, particularly if you already have lung disease. Treatment depends on what's causing the collapse and how severe it is. The definition of atelectasis is broader than pneumothorax (noo-moe-THOR-aks). Pneumothorax is when air leaks into the space between your lungs and chest wall, causing part or all of a lung to collapse. Pneumothorax is one of several causes of atelectasis.",

During atrial fibrillation, the heart's upper chambers, called the atria, beat chaotically and irregularly. They beat out of sync with the lower heart chambers, called the ventricles. AFib may cause a fast, pounding heartbeat, shortness of breath or light-headedness. Some people don't notice symptoms. Episodes of atrial fibrillation may come and go, or they may be constant. AFib itself usually isn't life-threatening. But it's a serious condition that needs proper treatment to prevent stroke. Treatment for AFib may include medicines, therapy to shock the heart back to a regular rhythm and procedures to block faulty heart signals. A person with atrial fibrillation also may have a related heart rhythm disorder called atrial flutter. The treatments for AFib and atrial flutter are similar.",

ADHD includes a mix of ongoing problems. These can include having a hard time paying attention, being hyperactive and being impulsive. Children with ADHD also may have low self-esteem and troubled relationships and do poorly in school. Symptoms sometimes lessen with age. Some people never completely outgrow their ADHD symptoms but they can learn strategies to be successful. While treatment won't cure ADHD, it can help a great deal with symptoms. Besides giving education about ADHD, treatment can involve medicines and behavior therapies. Early diagnosis and treatment can make a big difference in results.",

        "Overview": "Atypical genitalia, formerly called ambiguous genitalia, is a rare condition in which an infant's genitals don't appear to be clearly male or female on the outside. In a baby with atypical genitalia, the genitals may not be developed fully or may look different from what is expected. Or the baby may have features of more than one sex. The sex organs on the outside of the body may not match the sex organs on the inside. And they may not match the genetic sex, which is determined by sex chromosomes: typically, XX for females and XY for males. External genitals are the sex organs on the outside of the body. They include the opening of the vagina and the labia, clitoris, penis and scrotum. Internal genitals are the sex organs inside the body. They include the vagina, fallopian tubes, uterus, prostate, ovaries and testicles. Sex hormones are made by the ovaries and testicles, which also are called gonads. Genetic sex is set based on sex chromosomes. Typically, these sex chromosomes are a genetic female with two X chromosomes and a genetic male with one X and one Y chromosome. Atypical genitalia is not a disease; it's a difference of sex development. Usually, atypical genitalia can be seen at or shortly after birth. The condition can be very distressing for families. Your medical team looks for the cause of atypical genitalia and provides information and counseling that can help guide decisions about your baby's sex and any needed treatment.",

Autism spectrum disorder includes conditions that were once thought to be separate — autism, Asperger's syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder and a form of widespread developmental disorder that isn't specified. Autism spectrum disorder begins in early childhood. Over time, it can cause difficulty functioning in society. For example, people with autism spectrum disorder may have problems being social or when in school or at work. Often children show symptoms of autism within the first year of life. A small number of children with the condition appear to develop as expected in the first year. Then between 18 and 24 months of age, they may lose some skills and develop autism symptoms. There is no cure for autism spectrum disorder. But getting treatment early, during the preschool years, can make a big difference in the lives of many children with the condition.",

Autoimmune encephalitis is different from encephalitis caused by viral or bacterial infections, known as infectious encephalitis. Infectious encephalitis isn't caused by an immune reaction, and it's treated with different medicines. Research has found that the number of people with autoimmune encephalitis is comparable to the number of people with infectious encephalitis. Experts don't know what causes autoimmune encephalitis, also known as AE. For some people, AE is triggered by certain cancers or infections. Autoimmune encephalitis also may be triggered by medicines. People with an autoimmune disease or a family history of autoimmune disease may be more likely to get AE. Healthcare professionals use several tests to diagnose autoimmune encephalitis. Without treatment, autoimmune encephalitis can cause serious complications, including death. But treatments can lead to recovery. Many people with AE make a full recovery, but some can have lasting symptoms.",

It can occur with conditions that affect the immune system, especially autoimmune encephalitis. Autoimmune epilepsy also is known as autoimmune associated epilepsy and acute symptomatic seizures secondary to autoimmune encephalitis. The immune system protects the body from viruses, bacteria and other substances that can cause illnesses. Antibodies are proteins that are part of the immune system. In autoimmune epilepsy, antibodies mistakenly target receptors in the brain. This leads to swelling in the brain, also known as inflammation, and seizures. Antiseizure medicines usually don't do enough to manage seizures in people with autoimmune epilepsy. Instead, immunotherapy medicines help reduce the immune response on the brain. When immunotherapy is started early, it can reduce inflammation and improve seizures. For some people, treatment can stop seizures completely. For others, seizures may continue after treatment.",

        "Overview": "Barrett's esophagus is a condition in which the flat pink lining of the swallowing tube that connects the mouth to the stomach (esophagus) becomes damaged by acid reflux, which causes the lining to thicken and become red. Between the esophagus and the stomach is a critically important valve, the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Over time, theLESmay begin to fail, leading to acid and chemical damage of the esophagus, a condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).GERDis often accompanied by symptoms such as heartburn or regurgitation. In some people, thisGERDmay trigger a change in the cells lining the lower esophagus, causing Barrett's esophagus. Barrett's esophagus is associated with an increased risk of developing esophageal cancer. Although the risk of developing esophageal cancer is small, it's important to have regular checkups with careful imaging and extensive biopsies of the esophagus to check for precancerous cells (dysplasia). If precancerous cells are discovered, they can be treated to prevent esophageal cancer.",

B-cell lymphomas can affect lymph nodes, blood, bone marrow, and other tissues throughout the body, such as in the gastrointestinal system, central nervous system, bones or skin. There are many types of lymphoma. They are often divided into two categories: Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. B-cell lymphomas are a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. There are many subtypes of B-cell lymphoma. B-cell lymphomas get their names from the kind of cell that makes up these cancers. These cancers start in germ-fighting white blood cells called B cells. B cells also are called B lymphocytes. Treatment for B-cell lymphomas may include a \"watch and wait\" approach, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, clinical trials, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy, and bone marrow transplant, also called bone marrow stem cell transplant. There are many types of B-cell lymphoma, including: Healthcare professionals may describe B-cell lymphomas as either aggressive or indolent. Aggressive lymphomas grow quickly and may have more symptoms. Indolent lymphomas grow slowly and may not have symptoms at first. Treatments may vary depending on whether the lymphoma is aggressive or indolent. Some indolent lymphomas can change into aggressive lymphomas.",

        "Overview": "Bed-wetting — also called nighttime incontinence or nocturnal enuresis — means passing urine without intending to while asleep. This happens after the age at which staying dry at night can be reasonably expected. Soggy sheets and pajamas — and an embarrassed child — are a familiar scene in many homes. But don't get upset if your child wets the bed. Bed-wetting isn't a sign of problems with toilet training. It's often just a typical part of a child's development. Generally, bed-wetting before age 7 isn't a concern. At this age, your child may still be developing nighttime bladder control. If your child continues to wet the bed, treat the problem with patience and understanding. Lifestyle changes, bladder training, moisture alarms and sometimes medicine may help lessen bed-wetting.",

Bell's palsy also is known as acute peripheral facial palsy of unknown cause. It can occur at any age. The exact cause is not known. Experts think it's caused by swelling and irritation of the nerve that controls the muscles on one side of the face. Bell's palsy could be caused by a reaction that occurs after a viral infection. Symptoms usually start to improve within a few weeks, with complete recovery in about six months. A small number of people continue to have some Bell's palsy symptoms for life.

These glands make hormones that send messages to nearly every organ and tissue in the body. There are two adrenal glands, one above each kidney. Each gland has two types of tissue: the cortex and the medulla. Benign adrenal tumors that grow in the cortex are called adrenal adenomas. Those that grow in the medulla are called pheochromocytomas (fee-o-kroe-moe-sy-TOE-muhs). Most benign adrenal tumors cause no symptoms and don't need treatment. But sometimes these tumors make high levels of some hormones that can cause problems. Hormones from the cortex control metabolism, blood pressure and certain body features, such as hair growth. Hormones from the medulla control the body's response to stress.",

Several different types of tumors may form on the peripheral nerves. While some are caused by genetics, the cause of these tumors is usually not known. Although most of these types of tumors are not cancerous, they can cause nerve damage and loss of muscle control. It's important to see your healthcare professional if you have a lump or if you have pain, tingling, numbness or muscle weakness. Peripheral nerve tumors affect nerves by growing within them or by pressing against them. Peripheral nerve tumors that grow within nerves are called intraneural tumors. The tumors that press against nerves are called extraneural tumors. Most peripheral tumors are not cancer. These are known as benign tumors.

These include emotional highs, also known as mania or hypomania, and lows, also known as depression. Hypomania is less extreme than mania. When you become depressed, you may feel sad or hopeless and lose interest or pleasure in most activities. When your mood shifts to mania or hypomania, you may feel very excited and happy (euphoric), full of energy or unusually irritable. These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior and the ability to think clearly. Episodes of mood swings from depression to mania may occur rarely or multiple times a year. Each bout usually lasts several days. Between episodes, some people have long periods of emotional stability. Others may frequently have mood swings from depression to mania or both depression and mania at the same time. Although bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition, you can manage your mood swings and other symptoms by following a treatment plan. In most cases, healthcare professionals use medicines and talk therapy, also known as psychotherapy, to treat bipolar disorder.",

Depending on the strain, bird flu may cause the bird to have no symptoms, mild illness, serious illness or lead to the death of the bird. Bird flu rarely infects humans. But health officials worry because influenza A viruses that infect birds can change, called mutate, to infect humans and spread from person to person more often. Because a new strain of bird flu would be a new virus to humans, a mutated strain like that could spread quickly around the world. People most often catch a bird flu virus from close, long-term contact with live, domesticated poultry typically on farms or in backyard coops. People also may catch bird flu through contact with wild birds or another type of animal. Bird flu rarely has spread from person to person. In humans, flu is a viral infection of the nose, throat and lungs, which are part of the respiratory system. Symptoms of bird flu in humans are similar to flu symptoms and may be mild to serious.",

Bladder cancer most often begins in the cells (urothelial cells) that line the inside of your bladder. Urothelial cells are also found in your kidneys and the tubes (ureters) that connect the kidneys to the bladder. Urothelial cancer can happen in the kidneys and ureters, too, but it's much more common in the bladder. Most bladder cancers are diagnosed at an early stage, when the cancer is highly treatable. But even early-stage bladder cancers can come back after successful treatment. For this reason, people with bladder cancer typically need follow-up tests for years after treatment to look for bladder cancer that recurs.",

This area also is called the abdomen. The exposed bladder can't store urine or work as it should. This causes the baby to leak urine after being born. Bladder exstrophy also can affect the genitals, stomach muscles, pelvic bones, intestines and reproductive organs. The cause of the condition isn't clear, but genes may play a role. Bladder exstrophy may be spotted on a routine ultrasound during pregnancy. But sometimes, the condition can't be seen until the baby is born. A baby born with bladder exstrophy needs surgery to close the bladder and repair other affected body parts as needed.",

        "Overview": "Bone spurs are bony growths that form along bone edges. They're also called osteophytes. Bone spurs often form where bones meet each other — in the joints. They also can form on the bones of the spine. The main cause of bone spurs is the joint damage linked with the most common type of arthritis. This is called osteoarthritis. Bone spurs often cause no symptoms. You might not notice them, and your healthcare team might not happen to find them for years. Bone spurs might not need treatment. If treatment is needed, it depends on where spurs are located and how they affect your health.",

It includes a pattern of unstable, intense relationships, as well as impulsiveness and an unhealthy way of seeing themselves. Impulsiveness involves having extreme emotions and acting or doing things without thinking about them first. People with borderline personality disorder have a strong fear of abandonment or being left alone. Even though they want to have loving and lasting relationships, the fear of being abandoned often leads to mood swings and anger. It also leads to impulsiveness and self-injury that may push others away. Borderline personality disorder usually begins by early adulthood. The condition is most serious in young adulthood. Mood swings, anger and impulsiveness often get better with age. But the main issues of self-image and fear of being abandoned, as well as relationship issues, go on. If you have borderline personality disorder, know that many people with this condition get better with treatment. They can learn to live stabler, more-fulfilling lives.",

The condition can also occur when bacterial spores grow in the intestines of infants. In rare cases, botulism can also be caused by medical treatment or bioterrorism. Three common forms of botulism are: Occasionally, botulism happens when too much botulinum toxin is injected for cosmetic or medical reasons. This rare form is called iatrogenic botulism. The term \"iatrogenic\" means an illness caused by medical exam or treatment. Another rare form of botulism can occur from inhaling toxins. This may happen as the result of bioterrorism.

If you have bradycardia, your heart beats fewer than 60 times a minute. Bradycardia can be a serious problem if the heart rate is very slow and the heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood to the body. If this happens, you may feel dizzy, very tired or weak, and short of breath. Sometimes bradycardia doesn't cause symptoms or complications. A slow heart rate isn't always a concern. For example, a resting heart rate between 40 and 60 beats a minute is common in some people, particularly healthy young adults and trained athletes. It also is quite common during sleep. If bradycardia is severe, a pacemaker may be needed to help the heart beat at an appropriate rate.",

        "Overview": "A brain aneurysm (AN-yoo-riz-um) is a bulge or ballooning in a blood vessel in the brain. It's also known as a cerebral aneurysm or intracranial aneurysm. One type of aneurysm called a berry or saccular aneurysm looks like a berry hanging on a stem. Experts think brain aneurysms form and grow because blood flowing through the blood vessel puts pressure on a weak area of the vessel wall. This can increase the size of the brain aneurysm. If the brain aneurysm leaks or ruptures, it causes bleeding in the brain, known as a hemorrhagic stroke. Most often, a ruptured brain aneurysm happens in the space between the brain and the thin tissues covering the brain. This type of hemorrhagic stroke is called a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Brain aneurysms are common. But most brain aneurysms aren't serious, especially if they're small. Most brain aneurysms don't rupture. They usually don't cause symptoms or cause health problems. In many people, brain aneurysms are found during tests for other conditions. However, if an aneurysm ruptures it can quickly become life-threatening and requires emergency treatment. If a brain aneurysm hasn't ruptured, treatment may be right for some people. There are many factors to be considered. If it is felt that the treatment risk is lower than the future risk of aneurysm rupture, then treatment of an unruptured brain aneurysm may be recommended.

Arteries take oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the brain. Veins carry oxygen-depleted blood back to the lungs and heart. A brain AVM disrupts this vital process. An arteriovenous malformation can develop anywhere in the body, but common locations include the brain and spinal cord. Overall, brain AVMs are rare. The cause of brain AVMs isn't clear. Most people who have them are born with them, but they can form later in life. Rarely, AVM can be a trait passed down in families. Some people with brain AVMs experience symptoms such as headaches or seizures. A brain AVM may be found after a brain scan for another health issue. Sometimes a brain AVM is found after the blood vessels burst and bleed, known as a hemorrhage. Once diagnosed, a brain AVM can be treated to prevent complications such as brain damage or stroke.",

Nearby areas where brain tumors can happen include nerves, the pituitary gland, the pineal gland and the membranes that cover the surface of the brain. Brain tumors can begin in the brain. These are called primary brain tumors. Sometimes, cancer spreads to the brain from other parts of the body. These tumors are secondary brain tumors, also called metastatic brain tumors. There are many different types of primary brain tumors. Some brain tumors are not cancer. These are called noncancerous brain tumors or benign brain tumors. Noncancerous brain tumors may grow over time and press on the brain tissue. Other brain tumors are brain cancers, also called malignant brain tumors. Brain cancers may grow quickly. The cancer cells can invade and destroy brain tissue. Brain tumors range in size from very small to very large. Some brain tumors are found when they are very small because they cause symptoms that you notice right away. Other brain tumors grow very large before they're found. Some parts of the brain are less active than others. If a brain tumor starts in a part of the brain that's less active, it might not cause symptoms right away. The brain tumor could become quite large before the tumor is found. Brain cancers and brain tumors are not classified by stage as some types of cancer are. Brain tumors are graded from 1 to 4 based on a classification system of the World Health Organization (WHO). Grade 1 brain tumors are the least aggressive and grow slowly. Grade 4 brain tumors are the most aggressive and grow quickly. Grade 4 tumors are typically more difficult to treat and have lower survival rates than lower grade tumors. Brain tumor treatment options depend on the type of brain tumor you have, as well as its size and location. Common treatments include surgery and radiation therapy. There are many types of brain tumors. The type of brain tumor is based on the kind of cells that make up the tumor. Special lab tests on the tumor cells can give information about the cells. Your healthcare team uses this information to figure out the type of brain tumor. Some types of brain tumors usually aren't cancerous. These are called noncancerous brain tumors or benign brain tumors. Some types of brain tumors usually are cancerous. These types are called brain cancers or malignant brain tumors. Some brain tumor types can be either benign or malignant. Benign brain tumors tend to be slow-growing brain tumors. Malignant brain tumors tend to be fast-growing brain tumors.

After skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women in the United States. But breast cancer doesn't just happen in women. Everyone is born with some breast tissue, so anyone can get breast cancer. Breast cancer survival rates have been increasing. And the number of people dying of breast cancer is steadily going down. Much of this is due to the widespread support for breast cancer awareness and funding for research. Advances in breast cancer screening allow healthcare professionals to diagnose breast cancer earlier. Finding the cancer earlier makes it much more likely that the cancer can be cured. Even when breast cancer can't be cured, many treatments exist to extend life. New discoveries in breast cancer research are helping healthcare professionals choose the most effective treatment plans.",

        "Overview": "Breast cysts are fluid-filled sacs inside the breast. They are usually noncancerous (benign). You may have one or multiple breast cysts. A breast cyst often feels like a grape or a water-filled balloon, but sometimes a breast cyst feels firm. Breast cysts don't require treatment unless a cyst is large and painful or uncomfortable. In that case, draining the fluid from a breast cyst can ease symptoms. Although breast cysts can be found in women of any age, they're more common in women before menopause, typically under age 50. Breast cysts also commonly occur in postmenopausal women who take hormone therapy.",

        "Overview": "Breast pain (mastalgia) can be described as tenderness, throbbing, sharp, stabbing, burning pain or tightness in the breast tissue. The pain may be constant or it may occur only occasionally, and it can occur in men, women and transgender people. Breast pain can range from mild to severe. It may occur: In men, breast pain is most commonly caused by a condition called \"gynecomastia\" (guy-nuh-koh-MAS-tee-uh). This refers to an increase in the amount of breast gland tissue that's caused by an imbalance of the hormones estrogen and testosterone. Gynecomastia can affect one or both breasts, sometimes unevenly. In transgender women, hormone therapy may cause breast pain. In transgender men, breast pain may be caused by the minimal amount of breast tissue that may remain after a mastectomy. Most times, breast pain signals a noncancerous (benign) breast condition and rarely indicates breast cancer. Unexplained breast pain that doesn't go away after one or two menstrual cycles, or that persists after menopause, or breast pain that doesn't seem to be related to hormone changes needs to be evaluated.",

These small airways are called bronchioles. Bronchiolitis is almost always caused by a virus. Bronchiolitis starts out with symptoms much like a common cold. But then it gets worse, causing coughing and a high-pitched whistling sound when breathing out called wheezing. Sometimes children have trouble breathing. Symptoms of bronchiolitis can last for 1 to 2 weeks but occasionally can last longer. Most children get better with care at home. A small number of children need a stay in the hospital.",

People who have bronchitis often cough up thickened mucus, which can be discolored. Bronchitis may start suddenly and be short term (acute) or start gradually and become long term (chronic). Acute bronchitis, which often develops from a cold or other respiratory infection, is very common. Also called a chest cold, acute bronchitis usually improves within a week to 10 days without lasting effects, although the cough may linger for weeks. Chronic bronchitis, a more serious condition, is a constant irritation or inflammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes, often due to smoking. If you have repeated bouts of bronchitis, you may have chronic bronchitis, which requires medical attention. Chronic bronchitis is one of the conditions included in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).",

This reduces blood flow to the affected areas. Blood clots may form in the blood vessels. Over time, the lack of blood flow damages or destroys skin tissue. The damage can lead to infection and death of body tissue, called gangrene. Buerger disease is usually first seen in the feet. It may eventually affect the blood vessels of the hand. Blood clots may form in the small veins of the arms and legs. People who get Buerger disease almost always smoke cigarettes or use other forms of tobacco, such as chewing tobacco. Quitting all forms of tobacco is the only way to stop Buerger disease. For those who don't quit, surgery to remove fingers and toes might be needed.",

Then they try to get rid of the food and extra calories in an unhealthy way, such as vomiting or misusing laxatives. This is called purging. If you have bulimia, you probably focus on your weight and body shape even when you're trying to think about other things. You may judge yourself severely and harshly for what you see as flaws in your appearance and personality. Bulimia is related to how you see yourself — not just about food. It can be hard to overcome, and it can be dangerous. It's important to remember that an eating disorder is not something you choose. Bulimia is a complex illness that affects how your brain works and how you make decisions.

Blisters or sores also might form in the mouth, but this is rare. Bullous pemphigoid occurs when the immune system attacks a layer of tissue in the skin. The reason for this immune system response is not well understood. In some people, the condition is brought on by certain medicines. Bullous pemphigoid often goes away on its own in a few months, but it may take as many as five years to go away for good. Treatment usually helps heal the blisters and prevent new ones from forming.

The cancer cells can grow in the lymph nodes, jaw or other bones in the face, parts of the intestines, bone marrow, central nervous system, and other areas of the body. Burkitt lymphoma is an aggressive type of cancer, but it may be cured when diagnosed and treated right away. Treatment for Burkitt lymphoma often includes a combination of chemotherapy medicines. Other treatments may include immunotherapy, clinical trials, bone marrow transplant, also called a bone marrow stem cell transplant, and radiation therapy.

The most common form of the disorder involves a single enlarged lymph node. This lymph node is usually in the chest or neck, but it can occur in other areas of the body as well. This form of the disorder is called unicentric Castleman disease (UCD). Multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) involves multiple regions of enlarged lymph nodes, inflammatory symptoms and problems with organ function. There are three types of MCD: Sometimes, people may have 2-3 enlarged lymph nodes and mild symptoms that do not meet the diagnostic criteria for MCD. These people may have another disease, or they may have the recently described subtype of Castleman disease called oligocentric Castleman disease. This subtype is rare. Treatment and outlook vary depending on the type of Castleman disease you have. Unicentric Castleman disease, which is the type that involves only one enlarged lymph node, can usually be successfully treated with surgery. The best treatment for oligocentric Castleman disease, which involves a few enlarged lymph nodes and has limited symptoms, is not known but is thought to be similar to the treatment for unicentric Castleman disease. While not all people with MCD respond to the first treatment, there are medicines that work to treat HHV-8-associated MCD and idiopathic MCD.",

The vessels contain slow-moving blood that's usually clotted. CCMs look like small mulberries. In some people, CCMs can cause blood to leak in the brain or spinal cord. CCMs vary in size. Often they are less than half an inch (1 centimeter). Most CCMs are sporadic. This means the CCM occurs as a single cavernous malformation and there isn't a family history. But about 20% of CCMs affect people of the same family. These are known as familial CCMs. Familial CCMs are related to a gene change passed down through families. People with familial CCMs usually have multiple cavernous malformations. A CCM is one of several types of brain vascular malformations that contain irregular blood vessels. Other types of vascular malformations include: For people who have the sporadic form, it's common to have both a DVA and a CCM. CCMs may leak blood and lead to bleeding in the brain or spinal cord, known as a hemorrhage. Brain hemorrhages can cause many symptoms, such as seizures. Depending on the location, CCMs also can cause stroke-like symptoms such as trouble with movement or feeling in the legs and sometimes the arms. CCMs also may cause bowel and bladder symptoms.",

Gluten is a protein found in foods containing wheat, barley or rye. If you have celiac disease, eating gluten triggers an immune response to the gluten protein in your small intestine. Over time, this reaction can damage your small intestine's lining and prevent it from absorbing nutrients. This condition is called malabsorption. The intestinal damage often causes symptoms such as diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, bloating or anemia. It also can lead to serious complications if it is not managed or treated. In children, malabsorption can affect growth and development in addition to gastrointestinal symptoms. There's no definite cure for celiac disease.

Central sleep apnea is less common than obstructive sleep apnea. Central sleep apnea can happen because of other conditions, such as heart failure or stroke. Another possible cause is sleeping at a high altitude. Sometimes, managing existing conditions helps improve symptoms of central sleep apnea. Other treatments for central sleep apnea may include using a device to help breathing or using supplemental oxygen.",

        "Overview": "Cerebral palsy is a group of conditions that affect movement and posture. It's caused by damage that occurs to the developing brain, most often before birth. Symptoms appear during infancy or preschool years and vary from very mild to serious. Children with cerebral palsy may have exaggerated reflexes. The arms, legs and trunk may appear floppy. Or they may have stiff muscles, known as spasticity. Symptoms also can include irregular posture, movements that can't be controlled, a walk that's not steady or some combination of these. Cerebral palsy may make it hard to swallow. It also can cause eye muscle imbalance, in which the eyes don't focus on the same object. People with the condition might have reduced range of motion in their joints due to muscle stiffness. The cause of cerebral palsy and its effect on function vary from person to person. Some people with cerebral palsy can walk while others need assistance. Some people have intellectual disabilities, but others do not. Epilepsy, blindness or deafness also might affect some people with cerebral palsy. There is no cure, but treatments can help improve function. The symptoms of cerebral palsy may vary during the child's development, but the condition doesn't get worse. The condition generally stays the same over time.",

When exposed toHPV, the body's immune system typically prevents the virus from doing harm. In a small percentage of people, however, the virus survives for years. This contributes to the process that causes some cervical cells to become cancer cells. You can reduce your risk of developing cervical cancer by having screening tests and receiving a vaccine that protects againstHPVinfection. When cervical cancer happens, it's often first treated with surgery to remove the cancer. Other treatments may include medicines to kill the cancer cells. Options might include chemotherapy and targeted therapy medicines. Radiation therapy with powerful energy beams also may be used. Sometimes treatment combines radiation with low-dose chemotherapy.",

The type depends on the anatomy of the brain tissue that is pushed into the spinal canal. The type also depends on whether there are developmental changes of the brain or spine. Chiari malformation type 1 develops as the skull and brain are growing. Symptoms may not occur until late childhood or adulthood. The pediatric forms of Chiari malformation are type 2 and type 3. These types are present at birth, which is known as congenital. Treatment of Chiari malformation depends on the type and the symptoms. Regular monitoring, medicines and surgery are treatment options.

Most chondrosarcomas grow slowly and may not cause many signs and symptoms at first. Some rare types grow rapidly and have a high risk of spreading to other areas of the body, which can make these cancers difficult to treat. Chondrosarcoma treatment usually involves surgery.

Chordomas are different from other bone tumors for reasons including where they grow, how they start and who they affect. Chordomas can grow anywhere along the spine. But they often grow in two locations. The first is in a bone called the clivus. The clivus is located where the skull sits atop the spine, also called the skull base. The second is at the bottom of the spine, called the sacrum. Chordomas also can grow in the areas in between, sometimes called the mobile spine. Chordomas start in leftover cells that help form the spine before birth. Usually, any leftover cells go away soon after a baby is born. But sometimes a few of the cells stay. Rarely, in about 1 in 1 million people, the leftover cells eventually become cancerous. Chordomas can happen at any age. But they most often affect adults ages 40 to 60. Chordomas usually grow slowly. Surgery is usually the main treatment. However, chordomas can be hard to remove fully. This is because they grow very close to the spinal cord, blood vessels, nerves and brain. A chordoma often comes back after treatment. Different types of chordomas include:",

Bone marrow is the spongy tissue inside bones where blood cells are made.CMLcauses an increased number of white blood cells in the blood.

The term \"myelogenous\" (my-uh-LOHJ-uh-nus) refers to the type of cells affected by this cancer. Chronic myelogenous leukemia also can be called chronic myeloid leukemia and chronic granulocytic leukemia. It typically affects older adults and rarely occurs in children, though it can occur at any age. Advances in treatment have improved the prognosis of people with chronic myelogenous leukemia. Most people can achieve remission and live for many years after diagnosis.",

        ],
        "Overview": "Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, also known as CTE, is a brain disease likely caused by repeated head injuries. It causes the death of nerve cells in the brain, known as degeneration. CTE gets worse over time. The only way to definitively diagnosis CTE is after death during an autopsy of the brain. CTE is rare and not well understood, but experts don't believe it's related to a single head injury. CTE appears to be related to repeated head injuries, often occurring in contact sports or military combat. CTE also has been associated with second impact syndrome, when a second head injury occurs before symptoms of a previous head injury have fully resolved. Experts are still trying to understand how repeated head injuries and other factors might contribute to the changes in the brain that result in CTE. Researchers are looking at how the number of head injuries someone experiences and how bad the injuries are may affect risk of CTE. Experts also don't yet know how often CTE occurs in the population. CTE has been found in the brains of people who played U.S. football and other contact sports, including boxing. It also may occur in military members who were exposed to explosive blasts. Symptoms of CTE are thought to include trouble with thinking and emotions, physical symptoms, and other behaviors. It's thought that symptoms develop years to decades after head trauma occurs. Researchers are working on developing tests for CTE, but none has been validated yet. Healthcare professionals may diagnose traumatic encephalopathy syndrome when the symptoms associated with CTE occur together. There is no cure for CTE.",

        "Overview": "Cold sores, or fever blisters, are a common viral infection. They are tiny, fluid-filled blisters on and around the lips. These blisters are often grouped together in patches. After the blisters break, a scab forms that can last several days. Cold sores usually heal in 2 to 3 weeks without leaving a scar. Cold sores spread from person to person by close contact, such as kissing. They're usually caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), and less commonly herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). Both of these viruses can affect the mouth or genitals and can be spread by oral sex. The virus can spread even if you don't see the sores. There's no cure for cold sores, but treatment can help manage outbreaks. Prescription antiviral medicine or creams can help sores heal more quickly. And they may make future outbreaks happen less often and be shorter and less serious.",

The large intestine is the last part of the digestive system. The digestive system breaks down food for the body to use. Colon cancer typically affects older adults, though it can happen at any age. It usually begins as small clumps of cells called polyps that form inside the colon. Polyps generally aren't cancerous, but some can turn into colon cancers over time. Polyps often don't cause symptoms. For this reason, doctors recommend regular screening tests to look for polyps in the colon. Finding and removing polyps helps prevent colon cancer. If colon cancer develops, many treatments can help control it. Treatments include surgery, radiation therapy and medicines, such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy. Colon cancer is sometimes called colorectal cancer. This term combines colon cancer and rectal cancer, which begins in the rectum.",

But over time, some colon polyps can turn into colorectal cancer.Colorectal cancercan be deadly when found in its later stages. The most common type of precancerous polyp is an adenomatous polyp, often called an adenoma. Because adenomas are the polyps that most often change into colorectal cancer, healthcare professionals recommend removing them to prevent them from growing larger or becoming cancerous. Anyone can develop colon polyps, and your risk increases as you age. Your risk of colorectal cancer also is higher if you are overweight, smoke, have a personal history of colon polyps, or have a family history of advanced colon polyps or colorectal cancer. Colon polyps don't usually cause symptoms. It's important to have regular screening tests because colon polyps found early can usually be taken out safely and completely. The best prevention for colorectal cancer is regular screening. Medical professionals classify colon polyps into two groups, nonneoplastic and neoplastic. Nonneoplastic polyps are generally harmless and rarely turn into cancer. Neoplastic polyps are considered precancerous, which means they can turn into cancer if they are not taken out. Nonneoplastic polyps are generally considered harmless. They include: Neoplastic polyps are more likely to become cancerous. They include:",

Most people experiencing normal grief and bereavement have a period of sorrow, numbness, and even guilt and anger. Gradually these feelings ease, and it's possible to accept loss and move forward. For some people, feelings of loss are debilitating and don't improve even after time passes. This is known as complicated grief, sometimes called persistent complex bereavement disorder. In complicated grief, painful emotions are so long lasting and severe that you have trouble recovering from the loss and resuming your own life. Different people follow different paths through the grieving experience. The order and timing of these phases may vary from person to person: These differences are normal. But if you're unable to move through these stages more than a year after the death of a loved one, you may have complicated grief. If so, seek treatment. It can help you come to terms with your loss and reclaim a sense of acceptance and peace.",

        "Overview": "Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a rare condition that happens in a baby before birth. It occurs early in pregnancy when a baby's diaphragm — the muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen — fails to close as it should. This leaves a hole in the diaphragm. The hole is called a hernia. This hernia in the muscle of the diaphragm creates an opening between the abdomen and the chest. The intestines, stomach, liver and other abdominal organs may move through the hole into the baby's chest. If the intestines are in the chest, they don't develop the typical connections that hold them in place in the abdomen (malrotation). They may twist on themselves, cutting off their blood supply (volvulus). In addition, the lung is small on the side of the diaphragm with the hernia, but the development of both lungs is affected. The air sacs (alveoli) inside the lungs don't develop as they should. This results in problems with blood flow and increased pressure inside the lung's blood vessels. The blood pressure in the lungs is higher than it should be, which can make it hard for the baby to breathe after birth. Some infants may also have problems with heart development. Treatment ofCDHdepends on when the condition is found, how serious it is and whether there are problems with the heart.",

        "Overview": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an ongoing lung condition caused by damage to the lungs. The damage results in swelling and irritation, also called inflammation, inside the airways that limit airflow into and out of the lungs. This limited airflow is known as obstruction. Symptoms include trouble breathing, a daily cough that brings up mucus and a tight, whistling sound in the lungs called wheezing. COPD is most often caused by long-term exposure to irritating smoke, fumes, dust or chemicals. The most common cause is cigarette smoke. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the two most common types of COPD. These two conditions usually occur together and can vary in severity among people with COPD. Chronic bronchitis is inflammation of the lining of the tubes that bring air into the lungs. These tubes are called bronchi. The inflammation prevents good airflow into and out of the lungs and makes extra mucus. In emphysema, the small air sacs of the lungs, called alveoli, are damaged. The damaged alveoli can't pass enough oxygen into the bloodstream. Although COPD is a condition that can get worse over time, COPD is treatable. With proper management, most people with COPD can control symptoms and improve their quality of life. Proper management also can lower the risk of other conditions linked to COPD, such as heart disease and lung cancer.",

        "Overview": "Craniosynostosis (kray-nee-o-sin-os-TOE-sis) is a condition present at birth. It causes one or more of the joints between the bones of a baby's skull to close too early, before the brain is fully formed. A baby's skull is made up of small plates of bone connected by flexible, fibrous joints called sutures. The sutures allow a baby's skull to get bigger as the brain grows. The sutures usually close when the brain is done growing. Craniosynostosis usually involves early closing of one cranial suture but can involve more than one. Brain growth continues even when one or more sutures close too early. Open sutures on other sides of the head allow brain growth in those directions. This causes the head to have a shape that's not typical. Treating craniosynostosis involves surgery to reshape the skull. Early diagnosis and treatment allow the baby's brain enough space to grow and develop. After surgery, most children develop as expected and have a more average shape to the face and head.",

Crohn's most commonly affects the end of the small intestine and the beginning of the large intestine. The inflammation often spreads into the deeper layers of the bowel. Crohn's disease can be both painful and debilitating. Sometimes, it may lead to serious or life-threatening complications. There's no known cure for Crohn's disease, but therapies can greatly reduce its symptoms and even bring about long-term remission and healing of inflammation.

There are two distinct types ofCSFleaks: spinalCSFleaks and cranialCSFleaks. Each type has different symptoms, causes and treatments. A spinalCSFleak occurs anywhere in the spinal column. The most common symptom of a spinalCSFleak is a headache. A cranialCSFleak occurs in the skull, and often causes symptoms such as clear fluid leaking from the nose or ear.

But in people with CF, a changed gene causes the secretions to become sticky and thick. The secretions plug up pathways, especially in the lungs and pancreas. CF gets worse over time and needs daily care, but people with CF usually can attend school and work. They often have a better quality of life than people with CF had in past decades. Better screening and treatments mean that people with CF now may live into their mid- to late 50s or longer, and some are being diagnosed later in life.",

        "Overview": "Cystitis (sis-TIE-tis) is the medical term for inflammation of the bladder. Inflammation is when a part of your body is swollen and hot. It can also be painful. Most of the time, cystitis happens when there's an infection caused by bacteria. This is called a urinary tract infection (UTI). Having a bladder infection can be painful and annoying. It can become a serious health problem if the infection spreads to your kidneys. Cystitis also may occur as a reaction to certain drugs or radiation therapy. Things that sometimes irritate the bladder, such as hygiene products, spermicide jelly or long-term catheter use, can also lead to cystitis. Cystitis can also happen as a complication of another illness. The usual treatment for cystitis caused by bacteria is to take antibiotic medication. Treatment for other types of cystitis depends on the cause.",

        "Overview": "Diabetic nephropathy is a serious complication of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. It's also called diabetic kidney disease. In the United States, about 1 in 3 people living with diabetes have diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic nephropathy affects the kidneys' usual work of removing waste products and extra fluid from the body. The best way to prevent or delay diabetic nephropathy is by living a healthy lifestyle and keeping diabetes and high blood pressure managed. Over years, diabetic nephropathy slowly damages the kidneys' filtering system. Early treatment may prevent this condition or slow it and lower the chance of complications. Diabetic kidney disease can lead to kidney failure. This also is called end-stage kidney disease. Kidney failure is a life-threatening condition. Treatment options for kidney failure are dialysis or a kidney transplant.",

        "Overview": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a type of lymphoma. Lymphoma is cancer that affects the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is made up of organs, glands, tubelike vessels and clusters of cells called lymph nodes. It's part of the body's germ-fighting immune system. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma can affect lymph nodes, bone marrow, and other tissues throughout the body, such as in the gastrointestinal system, central nervous system, bones or skin. There are many types of lymphoma. Lymphoma types are often divided into two categories: Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. There are many subtypes of DLBCL. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma gets its name from the kind of cell that makes up this cancer. This cancer starts in germ-fighting white blood cells called B cells. B cells also are called B lymphocytes. When healthcare professionals look at the cells with a microscope, the cancer cells are larger than healthy cells. The cancer cells spread out in the tissue, so healthcare professionals say they are diffuse. DLBCL is a fast-growing cancer. However, it can often be treated and sometimes cured, especially when diagnosed early and treated right away. Treatment may include immunotherapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy and bone marrow transplant, also called bone marrow stem cell transplant. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a heterogeneous group of lymphomas. This means that the different subtypes have different genetic features, behaviors and responses to treatment. The subtypes depend on where the cancer is in the body, which genes and proteins are involved, and whether the cancer involves a virus such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma include:",

Now the term DMG is used to describe these tumors instead of the older term, DIPG. DIPG also may be called H3K27-altered DMG. The name DIPG means: DMG is an aggressive type of cancer. Symptoms of DMG usually start suddenly and quickly get worse. DMG may be diagnosed with a review of symptoms, a brain MRI and other tests. There is no cure for DMG. The most common treatments are radiation therapy and chemotherapy. These treatments aim to ease discomfort and help extend life, but they do not cure the cancer.",

An irregular, bulging pouch in the colon wall is called a diverticulum. Multiple pouches are called diverticula. Diverticula are common, especially after age 50. They are usually found in the lower part of the colon. Most often, they don't cause problems. The presence of diverticula is called diverticulosis. Diverticulosis isn't a disease condition. When these pouches become inflamed, the condition is called diverticulitis. Inflammation is immune system activity that increases blood flow and fluids to a site in the body and delivers disease-fighting cells. Inflammation of diverticula can cause severe pain, fever, nausea and changes in your stool habits. Mild diverticulitis is usually treated with rest, changes in your diet and possibly antibiotics. Severe diverticulitis usually needs antibiotic treatment in the hospital. Surgery may be needed for severe or frequent diverticulitis.",

A double uterus may have one opening into one vagina. This opening is called the cervix. In other cases, each uterus has its own cervix. Often, there's also a thin wall of tissue that runs down the length of the vagina. This divides the vagina in two, with two separate openings. Women who have a double uterus often have successful pregnancies. But the condition can make you more likely to have a miscarriage or premature birth.",

With a syndrome, there is a pattern of differences or problems. The condition is named after an English physician, John Langdon Down, who first described it. Down syndrome varies in severity among individuals. The condition causes lifelong intellectual disability and developmental delays. It's the most common genetic chromosomal cause of intellectual disabilities in children. It also commonly causes other medical conditions, including heart and digestive system problems. Better understanding of Down syndrome and early interventions can greatly improve the quality of life for children and adults with this condition and help them live fulfilling lives.",

Drug addiction can start with experimental use of a recreational drug in social situations, and, for some people, the drug use becomes more frequent. For others, particularly with opioids, drug addiction begins when they take prescribed medicines or receive them from others who have prescriptions. The risk of addiction and how fast you become addicted varies by drug. Some drugs, such as opioid painkillers, have a higher risk and cause addiction more quickly than others. As time passes, you may need larger doses of the drug to get high. Soon you may need the drug just to feel good. As your drug use increases, you may find that it's increasingly difficult to go without the drug. Attempts to stop drug use may cause intense cravings and make you feel physically ill. These are called withdrawal symptoms. Help from your health care provider, family, friends, support groups or an organized treatment program can help you overcome your drug addiction and stay drug-free.",

For others, dry mouth can greatly affect general health and the health of teeth and gums. Also, it can affect how much people eat and how much they enjoy what they eat. Treatment for dry mouth depends on the cause.",

        "Overview": "Dry socket is a painful dental condition that sometimes happens after you have a tooth removed. Having a tooth removed is called an extraction. Dry socket happens when a blood clot at the site where the tooth was removed does not form, comes out or dissolves before the wound has healed. Usually a blood clot forms at the site where a tooth was removed. This blood clot is a protective layer over the underlying bone and nerve endings in the empty tooth socket. Also, the clot contains cells that are needed for proper healing of the site. Intense pain happens when the underlying bone and nerves are exposed. Pain occurs in the socket and along the nerves to the side of the face. The socket becomes swollen and irritated. It may fill with bits of food, making the pain worse. If you get a dry socket, the pain usually begins 1 to 3 days after the tooth removal. Dry socket is the most common complication following tooth removals, such as the removal of third molars, also called wisdom teeth. Medicine you can buy without a prescription usually will not be enough to treat dry socket pain. Your dentist or oral surgeon can offer treatments to relieve your pain.",

Although somedAVFsstem from known causes, most often the cause is not known. It's thought thatdAVFsinvolving large brain veins form when one of the brain's venous sinuses narrows or becomes blocked. Venous sinuses are channels that route circulated blood from the brain back to the heart.

When it affects two or more areas of the body next to each other, it's called segmental dystonia. When dystonia affects all parts of the body, it's known as general dystonia. The muscle spasms can range from mild to more serious. They may be painful, and they can affect the person's ability to complete daily tasks. There's no cure for dystonia, but medicines and therapy can improve symptoms. Surgery is sometimes used to disable or regulate nerves or certain brain regions in people with serious dystonia.",

Blood pressure rises in the lungs' arteries. Eisenmenger syndrome causes permanent to the blood vessels in the lungs. Early diagnosis and repair of congenital heart defects usually prevents Eisenmenger syndrome. If it does develop, treatment involves regular health checkups and medicines to improve symptoms.",

They also can spread through the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, called cerebrospinal fluid. Embryonal tumors most often happen in babies and young children. But they can happen at any age. There are several kinds of embryonal tumors. The most common is medulloblastoma. This type of embryonal tumor starts in the lower back part of the brain, called the cerebellum. If your child is diagnosed with an embryonal tumor, seek care at a medical center that has experience caring for children with brain tumors.

But when the air sacs are damaged in emphysema, it's hard to move air out of your lungs. This doesn't leave room for fresh, oxygen-rich air to enter your lungs. Symptoms of emphysema include trouble breathing, especially with activity, and a wheezing sound when breathing out. How severe the condition is can vary. Smoking is the leading cause of emphysema. Treatment can help with symptoms and may slow how fast the condition gets worse. But it can't reverse the damage.",

Endometriosis tissue acts as the lining inside the uterus would — it thickens, breaks down and bleeds with each menstrual cycle. But it grows in places where it doesn't belong, and it doesn't leave the body. When endometriosis involves the ovaries, cysts called endometriomas may form. Surrounding tissue can become irritated and form scar tissue. Bands of fibrous tissue called adhesions also may form. These can cause pelvic tissues and organs to stick to each other. Endometriosis can cause pain, especially during menstrual periods. Fertility problems also may develop. But treatments can help you take charge of the condition and its complications.",

This buildup, which is a reaction to foods, allergens or acid reflux, can inflame or injure the esophageal tissue. Damaged esophageal tissue can lead to difficulty swallowing or cause food to get stuck when you swallow. Eosinophilic esophagitis has been identified only since the early '90s, but is now considered a major cause of digestive system illness. Research is ongoing and will likely lead to revisions in the diagnosis and treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis.",

These cells line the passageways that carry cerebrospinal fluid. This fluid surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord. There are different types of ependymomas. Some grow slowly and aren't considered cancerous. Noncancerous tumors also are called benign tumors. A benign ependymoma may grow to press on nearby tissue. Sometimes ependymomas grow more quickly and are considered cancerous. Cancerous tumors also are called malignant tumors. A malignant ependymoma may grow to invade and destroy nearby tissue. Cancerous cells can break away and spread within the brain or spinal cord. Ependymoma can occur at any age, but most often happens in young children. Children with ependymoma may experience headaches and seizures. Ependymoma that occurs in adults is more likely to form in the spinal cord. It may cause weakness in the part of the body controlled by the nerves affected by the tumor. Surgery is the primary treatment for ependymoma. For tumors that are growing quickly or for tumors that can't be removed completely with surgery, additional treatments may be recommended. These may include radiation therapy, radiosurgery, chemotherapy or targeted therapy.",

Others may repeatedly twitch their arms or legs, movements known as convulsions. Having a single seizure doesn't mean you have epilepsy. Epilepsy is diagnosed if you've had at least two seizures without a clear cause at least 24 hours apart. Seizures that don't have a clear cause are known as unprovoked seizures.

Factitious disorder symptoms can range from mild to severe. People may make up symptoms or even tamper with medical tests to convince others that they need treatment, such as high-risk surgery. Factitious disorder isn't the same as making up medical issues for a benefit or reward, such as getting out of work or winning a lawsuit. Although people with factitious disorder know they are causing their symptoms or illnesses, they may not know why they do what they do or see themselves as having mental health issues. Factitious disorder is a rare condition that can be hard to diagnose and treat. Help from medical and mental health professionals is critical to prevent serious injury and even death when people with factitious disorder hurt themselves.",

Women who carry the factor V Leiden mutation may have an increased tendency to develop blood clots during pregnancy or when taking the hormone estrogen.

But for 25 to 30 percent of people, the genetic mutation occurs spontaneously. FAP causes extra tissue (polyps) to form in your large intestine (colon) and rectum. Polyps can also occur in the upper gastrointestinal tract, especially the upper part of your small intestine (duodenum). If untreated, the polyps in the colon and rectum are likely to become cancerous when you are in your 40s. Most people with familial adenomatous polyposis eventually need surgery to remove the large intestine to prevent cancer. The polyps in the duodenum also can develop cancer, but they can usually be managed by careful monitoring and by removing polyps regularly. Some people have a milder form of the condition, called attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (AFAP). People with AFAP usually have fewer colon polyps (an average of 30) and develop cancer later in life.",

Breast changes that fluctuate with the menstrual cycle and have a ropelike texture are considered normal. Fibrocystic breast changes don't always cause symptoms. Some people experience breast pain, tenderness and lumpiness — especially in the upper, outer area of the breasts. Breast symptoms tend to be most bothersome just before menstruation and get better afterward. Simple self-care measures can usually relieve discomfort associated with fibrocystic breasts.",

Follicular lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Follicular lymphoma gets its name from the fact that the cancer starts in the follicles of the lymph nodes. Lymph node follicles are groups of germ-fighting white blood cells that are inside each lymph node. When these white blood cells become cancer cells, they may build up in the lymph nodes and continue to gather in groups that look like follicles. Follicular lymphoma tends to grow slowly. It's often not found until it affects many parts of the body. Treatment may include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy targeted therapy and CAR-T cell therapy.

        "Overview": "Frontal lobe seizures are a common form of epilepsy. Epilepsy is a brain disorder in which clusters of brain cells send a burst of electrical signals. This causes movements that can't be controlled, known as seizures. Frontal lobe seizures begin in the front of the brain, the area known as the frontal lobe. The frontal lobe is large and has important functions. For this reason, frontal lobe seizures can produce symptoms that are unusual and may appear to be related to a mental illness. The seizures also can be mistaken for a sleep disorder because they often occur during sleep. Frontal lobe seizures also are known as frontal lobe epilepsy. Changes in brain tissue, infection, injury, stroke, tumors or other conditions can cause frontal lobe seizures. Medicines can help control the seizures. Surgery or electrical stimulation might be options if medicines don't reduce or stop the seizures.",

These areas of the brain are associated with personality, behavior and language. In frontotemporal dementia, parts of these lobes shrink, known as atrophy. Symptoms depend on which part of the brain is affected. Some people with frontotemporal dementia have changes in their personalities. They become socially inappropriate and may be impulsive or emotionally indifferent. Others lose the ability to properly use language. Frontotemporal dementia can be misdiagnosed as a mental health condition or as Alzheimer's disease. ButFTDtends to occur at a younger age than does Alzheimer's disease. It often begins between the ages of 40 and 65, although it can occur later in life as well.FTDis the cause of dementia about 10% to 20% of the time.",

Most often, muscles contract to send food through the digestive tract. But with gastroparesis, the stomach's movement, called motility, slows or doesn't work at all. This keeps the stomach from emptying well. Often, the cause of gastroparesis is not known. Sometimes it's linked to diabetes. And some people get gastroparesis after surgery or after a viral illness. Certain medicines, such as opioid pain relievers, some antidepressants, and medicines for high blood pressure, weight loss and allergies can slow stomach emptying. The symptoms can be like those of gastroparesis. For people who already have gastroparesis, these medicines may make the condition worse. Gastroparesis affects digestion. It can cause nausea, vomiting and belly pain. It also can cause problems with blood sugar levels and nutrition. There's no cure for gastroparesis.

Many forms of glaucoma have no warning signs. The effect is so gradual that you may not notice a change in vision until the condition is in its later stages. It's important to have regular eye exams that include measurements of your eye pressure. If glaucoma is found early, vision loss can be slowed or prevented.

        "Overview": "Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection, also called a sexually transmitted disease, caused by bacteria. Sexually transmitted diseases are infections spread mainly by contact with genitals or bodily fluids. Also called STDs, STIs or venereal disease, sexually transmitted infections are caused by bacteria, viruses or parasites. Gonorrhea bacteria can infect the urethra, rectum, female reproductive tract, mouth, throat or eyes. Gonorrhea is most commonly spread during vaginal, oral or anal sexual activity. But babies can get the infection during childbirth. In babies, gonorrhea most commonly affects the eyes. Avoiding sexual activity and not having sex prevents the spread of gonorrhea. Using a condom during sexual activity can help prevent the spread of gonorrhea. Being in a mutually monogamous relationship, in which both partners have sex only with each other and neither partner is infected, also limits the risk of an infection.",

Granulomas can damage these organs and affect how they work. Symptoms of GPA vary. At first, the symptoms can seem like those of a cold. Other symptoms depend on which organs the disease affects. The cause of GPA isn't clear, but the immune system may play a role. It's important for healthcare professionals to find and treat GPA as soon as possible. Early treatment can help people live full lives. Without treatment, the condition can lead to organ damage that sometimes is fatal.",

The white blood cells involved in hairy cell leukemia are called B cells. B cells are also called B lymphocytes. In hairy cell leukemia, the body makes too manyB cells. The cells don't look like healthyB cells. Instead, they've undergone changes to become leukemia cells. The leukemia cells look \"hairy\" under a microscope. Hairy cell leukemia cells keep living when healthy cells would die as part of the natural cell life cycle. The leukemia cells build up in the body and cause symptoms. Hairy cell leukemia often gets worse slowly. Treatment might not need to start right away. When it's needed, treatment is usually with chemotherapy. Scientists found a type of cancer that looks like hairy cell leukemia, but it gets worse much faster. This other type of cancer is called hairy cell leukemia variant. It's considered a separate type of cancer from hairy cell leukemia, even though it has a similar name.",

But other cancers can happen in the head and neck and are sometimes considered part of this category too. Head and neck cancer isn't a diagnosis. Instead, it's a category of cancers that have some things in common. For example, many head and neck cancers share some risk factors and treatments. Most head and neck cancers begin in squamous cells. These thin, flat cells make up the outer layer of the skin. They also line the inside of the nose, mouth and throat. Cancers that begin in the squamous cells are called squamous cell carcinomas. Cancers can begin in other kinds of cells in the head and neck area, though these are less common. Which treatment you'll have for your head and neck cancer depends on many factors. These might include the location of the cancer, its size and the type of cells involved. Your healthcare team also considers your overall health. Treatment options might include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and others.",

        "Overview": "A heart arrhythmia (uh-RITH-me-uh) is an irregular heartbeat. A heart arrhythmia occurs when the electrical signals that tell the heart to beat don't work properly. The heart may beat too fast or too slow. Or the pattern of the heartbeat may be inconsistent. A heart arrhythmia may feel like a fluttering, pounding or racing heartbeat. Some heart arrhythmias are harmless. Others may cause life-threatening symptoms. There are times when it is OK to have a fast or slow heartbeat. For example, the heart may beat faster with exercise or slow down during sleep. Heart arrhythmia treatment may include medicines, devices such as pacemakers, or a procedure or surgery. The goals of treatment are to control or get rid of fast, slow or otherwise irregular heartbeats. A heart-healthy lifestyle can help prevent heart damage that can trigger some heart arrhythmias. In general, heart arrhythmias are grouped by the speed of the heart rate. For example: Types of tachycardias include: A heart rate below 60 beats a minute is considered bradycardia. But a low resting heart rate doesn't always mean there's a problem. If you're physically fit, your heart may be able to pump enough blood to the body with less than 60 beats a minute. If you have a slow heart rate and your heart isn't pumping enough blood, you may have a type of bradycardia. Types of bradycardias include: Premature heartbeats are extra beats that occur one at a time, sometimes in patterns that alternate with a regular heartbeat. If the extra beats come from the top chamber of the heart, they are called premature atrial contractions (PACs). If they come from the bottom chamber, they are called premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). A premature heartbeat may feel like your heart skipped a beat. These extra beats are generally not a concern. They rarely mean you have a more serious condition. Still, a premature beat can trigger a longer lasting arrhythmia, especially in people with heart disease. Occasionally, having very frequent premature ventricular beats may lead to a weak heart. Premature heartbeats may occur when resting. Stress, heavy exercise and the use of stimulants, such as caffeine or nicotine, also may cause premature heartbeats.",

A hemangioma typically appears on the face, scalp, chest or back, though it can be anywhere on the skin. Treatment generally isn't needed for a baby's hemangioma, as the mark fades over time. Typically, there is little trace of it by age 10. You may want to think about treatment for the child if a hemangioma leads to problems with vision, breathing or other bodily functions. You also may think about treatment if the hemangioma is in a cosmetically sensitive area.",

There are a few types of hemochromatosis, but the most common type is caused by a gene change passed down through families. Only a few people who have the genes ever develop serious problems. Symptoms usually appear in midlife. Treatment includes regularly removing blood from the body. Because much of the body's iron is contained in red blood cells, this treatment lowers iron levels.",

If you have hemophilia, you might bleed for a longer time after an injury than you would if your blood clotted properly. Small cuts usually aren't much of a problem. If you have a severe form of the condition, the main concern is bleeding inside your body, especially in your knees, ankles and elbows. Internal bleeding can damage your organs and tissues and be life-threatening. Hemophilia is almost always a genetic disorder. Treatment includes regular replacement of the specific clotting factor that is reduced. Newer therapies that don't contain clotting factors also are being used.",

Hepatic encephalopathy occurs in 30% to 40% of people who have cirrhosis. Alcohol use, infections, use of some medicines and blood clots in the veins also may cause hepatic encephalopathy. Prompt treatment is needed for hepatic encephalopathy to prevent death. Call 911 or emergency medical help if you think you or a loved one might have hepatic encephalopathy. There are three types of hepatic encephalopathy: Acute hepatic encephalopathy comes on suddenly. Chronic hepatic encephalopathy is long-lasting. People who have hepatic encephalopathy may have a wide range of cognitive or mental changes, which range from barely noticeable to coma.

Acute hepatitis B lasts less than six months. But for others, the infection lasts more than six months and is called chronic. Chronic hepatitis B raises the risk of liver failure, liver cancer and serious scarring of the liver called cirrhosis. Most adults with hepatitis B recover fully, even if their symptoms are bad. Infants and children are more likely to develop a chronic, long-lasting hepatitis B virus infection. A vaccine can prevent infection with the hepatitis B virus. For those who get infected, treatment depends on whether the infection is acute or chronic. Some people need medicine. Others with serious liver damage from a chronic infection need a liver transplant. If you're infected, taking certain safety measures can help prevent spreading the virus to others.",

        "Overview": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a type of cancer that starts as a growth of cells in the liver. The liver is an organ that sits just under the rib cage on the right side of the belly. It helps the body digest food and get rid of waste products, among other tasks. Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common type ofliver cancer. It starts in liver cells called hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma happens most often in people with chronic liver conditions, such as cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection. Hepatocellular carcinoma happens when liver disease or something else changes the cells in the liver. The changes cause the cells to make many more diseased cells that form a growth called a tumor. The tumor can hurt healthy liver tissue and grow into nearby blood vessels. The cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most serious cancers. It may not cause symptoms right away, which means it can grow without being detected. It also tends to happen in people with serious liver disease, which may make treatment more difficult. Treatment often depends on how advanced the cancer is and how well the liver is working. Hepatocellular carcinoma treatment may include surgery to remove the cancer or a liver transplant. Other treatments may include ablation, embolization, radiation therapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy. Hepatocellular carcinoma differs from another kind of liver cancer called intrahepaticcholangiocarcinoma. This other type starts in the bile ducts in the liver, rather than in the liver tissue. They are both kinds of liver cancer, but they have different risk factors and treatments. Another type of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma mostly affects young children. These are all types of malignant neoplasms of the liver, which is a medical term that means cancer in the liver. Hepatocellular carcinoma doesn't have types. Fibrolamellar carcinoma is sometimes described as a subtype or variant of hepatocellular carcinoma because both cancers are thought to start in hepatocytes. But fibrolamellar carcinoma acts differently than most hepatocellular carcinomas. Healthcare professionals don't agree on whether hepatocellular carcinoma and fibrolamellar carcinoma are related or not. Fibrolamellar carcinoma happens most often in young adults who don't have liver disease. It's most often treated with surgery. Fibrolamellar carcinoma often doesn't cause high levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the blood, as most hepatocellular carcinomas do.",

A herniated disk occurs when some of the nucleus pushes out through a tear in the annulus. A herniated disk is sometimes called a slipped disk or a ruptured disk. A herniated disk, which can occur in any part of the spine, most often occurs in the lower back. Depending on where the herniated disk is, it can result in pain, numbness or weakness in an arm or a leg. Many people have no symptoms from a herniated disk. For people who do have symptoms, the symptoms tend to improve over time. Surgery is usually not needed to relieve the problem.",

In a hiatal hernia, the stomach pushes up through that opening and into the chest. A small hiatal hernia usually doesn't cause problems. You may never know you have one unless your healthcare team discovers it when checking for another condition. But a large hiatal hernia can allow food and acid to back up into your esophagus. This can cause heartburn. Self-care measures or medicines can usually relieve these symptoms. A very large hiatal hernia might need surgery.",

        "Overview": "Cholesterol is a waxy substance found in the blood. The body needs cholesterol to build healthy cells. But high levels of cholesterol can raise the risk of heart disease. With high cholesterol, fats and other substances can build up in blood vessels called arteries. This buildup is called plaque. As more plaque forms over time, the arteries can become narrowed or clogged. That makes it hard for enough blood to flow through the arteries. Sometimes a piece of plaque can break loose and form a blood clot. The clot may cause a heart attack or stroke. High cholesterol can be inherited. That means it can pass from parents to children through genes. But high cholesterol often is the result of lifestyle choices such as not getting enough exercise, not eating a balanced diet or consuming large amounts of saturated fat. You can make changes to help prevent it. And if you have high cholesterol, you can help lower it with a healthy diet, regular exercise and sometimes medicine.",

Hip dysplasia can damage the cartilage lining the joint. It also can hurt the soft cartilage, called the labrum, that rims the socket portion of the hip joint. This is called a hip labral tear.

Countertops, sinks, stoves, desks, stairways and all other surfaces are usually piled with stuff. You may not be able to use some areas for their intended purpose. For example, you may not be able to cook in the kitchen. When there's no more room inside your home, the clutter may spread to the garage, vehicles, yard and other storage areas. Hoarding ranges from mild to severe. In some cases, hoarding may not have much impact on your life, while in other cases it seriously affects your daily functioning.

The lymphatic system also includes the spleen, thymus, tonsils, adenoids and bone marrow. Hodgkin lymphoma, which used to be called Hodgkin disease, can affect all these areas and other organs in the body. There are many types of lymphoma. Lymphoma types are often divided into two categories: Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Hodgkin lymphoma starts in germ-fighting white blood cells called B lymphocytes. Hodgkin lymphoma is highly treatable and often curable. Treatments for Hodgkin lymphoma may include chemotherapy, radiation, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, bone marrow transplant, also called bone marrow stem cell transplant, and clinical trials. Classic Hodgkin lymphoma is the most common type of Hodgkin lymphoma. People diagnosed with this type have large lymphoma cells called Reed-Sternberg cells in their lymph nodes. Subtypes of classic Hodgkin lymphoma include: Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma is much rarer. It involves lymphoma cells sometimes called popcorn cells because of how they look. Usually, it is diagnosed early and may need less intensive treatments than the classic type of Hodgkin lymphoma.",

Huntington's disease is rare. It's often passed down through a changed gene from a parent. Huntington's disease symptoms can develop at any time, but they often begin when people are in their 30s or 40s. If the disease develops before age 20, it's called juvenile Huntington's disease. When Huntington's develops early, symptoms can be different and the disease may have a faster progression. Medicines are available to help manage the symptoms of Huntington's disease. However, treatments can't prevent the physical, mental and behavioral decline caused by the disease.",

Hypoglycemia is often related to diabetes treatment. But other drugs and a variety of conditions — many rare — can cause low blood sugar in people who don't have diabetes. Hypoglycemia needs immediate treatment. For many people, a fasting blood sugar of 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 3.9 millimoles per liter (mmol/L), or below should serve as an alert for hypoglycemia. But your numbers might be different. Ask your health care provider. Treatment involves quickly getting your blood sugar back to within the standard range either with a high-sugar food or drink or with medication. Long-term treatment requires identifying and treating the cause of hypoglycemia.",

Sodium is an electrolyte, and it helps regulate the amount of water that's in and around your cells. In hyponatremia, one or more factors cause the sodium in the body to be diluted. These factors can range from an underlying medical condition to drinking too much water. When this happens, the body's water levels rise, and cells begin to swell. This swelling can cause many health problems, from mild to life-threatening. Hyponatremia treatment is aimed at resolving the underlying condition. Depending on the cause of hyponatremia, you may simply need to cut back on how much you drink. In other cases of hyponatremia, you may need intravenous electrolyte solutions and medications.",

The pituitary gland is a kidney-bean-sized gland at the base of your brain. It is part of the body's system of glands that make hormones, called the endocrine system. The pituitary gland makes several hormones. They act on nearly every part of the body. Hypopituitarism is when there isn't enough of one or more of the pituitary hormones. This lack of hormones, called a deficiency, can affect how the body works in many ways. These include growth, blood pressure and the ability to have children, among others. Symptoms depend on which hormones are missing. People who have hypopituitarism usually need to take medicines for the rest of their lives. These medicines replace the missing hormones, which helps control symptoms.",

        "Overview": "IgAnephropathy (nuh-FROP-uh-thee), also known as Berger disease, is a kidney disease. It happens when a germ-fighting protein called immunoglobulin A (IgA) builds up in the kidneys. This causes a type of swelling called inflammation that, over time, can make it harder for the kidneys to filter waste from the blood. IgAnephropathy often becomes worse slowly over years. But the course of the disease varies from person to person. Some people leak blood into their urine without having other problems. Others might have complications such as losing kidney function and spilling protein into the urine. Still others develop kidney failure, which means the kidneys stop working well enough to filter the body's waste on their own. There's no cure forIgAnephropathy, but medicines can slow how quickly it becomes worse. Some people need treatment to lower inflammation, reduce the spilling of protein into the urine and prevent the kidneys from failing. Such treatments may help the disease become not active, a state called remission. Keeping blood pressure under control and lowering cholesterol also slow the disease.",

        "Overview": "Illness anxiety disorder, sometimes called hypochondriasis or health anxiety, is worrying excessively that you are or may become seriously ill. You may have no physical symptoms. Or you may believe that normal body sensations or minor symptoms are signs of severe illness, even though a thorough medical exam doesn't reveal a serious medical condition. You may experience extreme anxiety that body sensations, such as muscle twitching or fatigue, are associated with a specific, serious illness. This excessive anxiety — rather than the physical symptom itself — results in severe distress that can disrupt your life. Illness anxiety disorder is a long-term condition that can fluctuate in severity. It may increase with age or during times of stress. But psychological counseling (psychotherapy) and sometimes medication can help ease your worries. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association, no longer includes hypochondriasis — also called hypochondria — as a diagnosis. Instead, people previously diagnosed with hypochondriasis may be diagnosed as having illness anxiety disorder, in which the focus of the fear and worry is on uncomfortable or unusual physical sensations being an indication of a serious medical condition. On the other hand, somatic symptom disorder — a related disorder — involves focusing on the disabling nature of physical symptoms, such as pain or dizziness, without the worry that these symptoms represent a specific illness.",

Sometimes they don't cause any problems. But because wisdom teeth are hard to clean, they may be more prone to tooth decay and gum disease than other teeth. Impacted wisdom teeth that cause pain or other dental problems usually are taken out. Some dentists and oral surgeons also recommend taking out impacted wisdom teeth that don't cause symptoms to prevent future problems.",

An incompetent cervix also is called cervical insufficiency. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus that opens to the vagina. Before pregnancy, it's usually closed and firm. As pregnancy goes on and you get ready to give birth, the cervix slowly changes. It softens, gets shorter and opens. If you have an incompetent cervix, it might begin to open too soon causing you to give birth too early. An incompetent cervix can be a hard problem to diagnose and treat. If your cervix begins to open early, or if you've had cervical insufficiency in the past, you might benefit from treatment. This might include having a procedure done to close the cervix with strong sutures, called a cervical cerclage. You also may take medicine to help the incompetent cervix and have ultrasound exams to check how things are going.",

Rarely, infant reflux leads to weight loss or growth that lags behind that of other children of the same age and sex. These symptoms may mean that your baby has a medical issue. This issue could be an allergy, a blockage in the digestive system or gastroesophageal reflux disease, also called GERD. GERD is a form of GER that causes serious health issues.",

Aside from the vaccine, you can take other steps to help prevent infection with the flu. You can clean and disinfect surfaces, wash hands, and keep the air around you moving.",

Most of these conditions cause inflammation and progressive scarring of lung tissue. As part of this process, lung tissue thickens and stiffens, making it hard for the lungs to expand and fill with air. At some point, the scarring from interstitial lung disease makes it harder to breathe and get enough oxygen into the bloodstream. Many people with ILD are short of breath with activity and may have a bothersome dry cough. Interstitial lung disease can have many causes, including long-term exposure to hazardous materials such as asbestos. Some types of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, also can cause interstitial lung disease. But the cause isn't known sometimes. ILD can have many causes, so treatment varies. The disease may get worse slowly or rapidly at a pace that often can't be predicted. Once lung scarring occurs, it generally isn't reversible. Treatment focuses on keeping more scarring from occurring, managing symptoms and making quality of life better. Medicines may slow the damage of interstitial lung disease, but many people never fully use their lungs again. Lung transplant is an option for some people who have ILD.",

Less blood flow means that too little oxygen goes to the cells in the system through which food travels, called the digestive system. Intestinal ischemia is a serious condition that can cause pain. It can make it hard for the intestines to work well. In severe cases, loss of blood flow to the intestines can cause lifelong damage to the intestines. And it may lead to death.

The cells have the potential to spread to the lymph nodes and other areas of the body. Invasive lobular carcinoma makes up a small portion of all breast cancers. The most common type of breast cancer begins in the breast ducts. This type is called invasive ductal carcinoma.",

Causes of reduced blood flow may include narrowing of the blood vessels supplying the colon or low blood pressure. Ischemic colitis is also called colonic ischemia. Any part of the colon can be affected, but ischemic colitis most commonly causes pain on the left side of the belly area. Ischemic colitis can be hard to diagnose because it can easily be confused with other digestive problems. You may need medicine to treat ischemic colitis or prevent infection. Or you may need surgery if your colon has been damaged. Most often, however, ischemic colitis heals on its own.",

A cone-shaped cornea causes blurred vision and may cause sensitivity to light and glare. Keratoconus usually affects both eyes. However, it can affect one eye more than the other. It generally begins to affect people between the late teens and 30 years of age. The condition may progress slowly for 10 years or longer. In the early stages of keratoconus, you might be able to correct vision problems with glasses or soft contact lenses. Later, you may have to be fitted with rigid, gas permeable contact lenses or other types of lenses, such as scleral lenses. If your condition gets worse, you may need a cornea transplant. A procedure called corneal collagen cross-linking may help to slow or stop keratoconus from progressing, possibly preventing the need for a future cornea transplant. This treatment may be offered in addition to the vision correction options above.",

Other, less common types of kidney cancer can happen. Young children are more likely to develop a kind of kidney cancer called Wilms tumor. The number of kidney cancers diagnosed each year seems to be increasing. One reason for this may be the fact that imaging techniques such as CT scans are being used more often. These tests may lead to the incidental discovery of more kidney cancers. Kidney cancer is often found when the cancer is small and confined to the kidney.",

Kidney stones can affect any of the organs that make urine or remove it from the body — from the kidneys to the bladder. Often, stones form when the urine has less water in it. This lets minerals form crystals and stick together. Passing kidney stones can be quite painful. But prompt treatment usually helps prevent any lasting damage. Sometimes, the only treatment needed to pass a kidney stone is taking pain medicine and drinking lots of water. Other times, surgery or other treatments may be needed. It depends on size, location and the type of stone you have. If you've had more than one kidney stone, your healthcare professional can show you ways to prevent more.

It can cause much emotional pain to you and your loved ones — and even legal problems — if not treated. Kleptomania is a type of impulse control disorder — a disorder that involves problems with emotional or behavioral self-control. If you have an impulse control disorder, you have difficulty resisting the temptation or powerful urge to perform an act that's excessive or harmful to you or someone else. Many people with kleptomania live lives of secret shame because they're afraid to seek mental health treatment.

Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic condition that occurs before birth, but it often isn't diagnosed until adulthood. Klinefelter syndrome may affect testicular growth. This results in smaller testicles, which can lead to making less of the hormone testosterone. The syndrome also may cause smaller muscle mass, less body and facial hair, and extra breast tissue. The effects of Klinefelter syndrome vary, and not everyone has the same symptoms. Most people with Klinefelter syndrome produce little or no sperm, but assisted reproductive procedures may make it possible for some people with Klinefelter syndrome to have biological children.",

Sometimes the patches form on the tongue. These patches cannot be scraped off. Doctors do not know the exact cause of leukoplakia. But ongoing irritation from tobacco — whether smoked, dipped or chewed — may be the most common cause. Long-term alcohol use is another possible cause. Most leukoplakia patches are not cancer. But some patches show early signs of cancer. Cancers in the mouth can occur next to areas of leukoplakia. White areas mixed with red areas, also called speckled leukoplakia, may possibly lead to cancer. It's best to see your dentist or doctor if you have any changes in your mouth that do not go away. A type of leukoplakia in the mouth called hairy leukoplakia mainly affects people whose immune systems have been weakened by disease, especially HIV/AIDS.",

        "Overview": "Mantle cell lymphoma is a type of lymphoma. Lymphoma is cancer that affects the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is made up of organs, glands, tubelike vessels and clusters of cells called lymph nodes. It's part of the body's germ-fighting immune system. Mantle cell lymphoma typically affects the lymph nodes, but it also can affect the blood, bone marrow and other tissues throughout the body. There are many types of lymphoma. Lymphoma types are often divided into two categories: Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Mantle cell lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Mantle cell lymphoma gets its name from the fact that the cancer starts inside an area called the mantle zone of a lymph node. The mantle zone is a ring of cells surrounding the inner part of the lymph node. These cells are germ-fighting white blood cells called B lymphocytes. In mantle cell lymphoma, changes happen that turn the B lymphocytes into cancer cells. The cancer cells build up in the lymph nodes and other parts of the body. Mantle cell lymphoma is a rare and often aggressive type of cancer. Treatment for mantle cell lymphoma may include radiation therapy, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, CAR-T cell therapy and bone marrow transplant, also called a bone marrow stem cell transplant. While mantle cell lymphoma often can't be cured, treatments can shrink the cancer size and help contain it. Treatment may increase the time that the cancer stays away, known as remission, and help prolong life. The types of mantle cell lymphoma include: Classic and leukemic nonnodal mantle cell lymphomas can have variants called blastoid and pleomorphic variants. These are rare but aggressive types of mantle cell lymphoma. They are found in the lymph nodes and bone marrow and can spread to other organs. These variants are often harder to treat and need stronger therapy.",

The damage caused by Marfan syndrome can be mild or severe. If your aorta — the large blood vessel that carries blood from your heart to the rest of your body — is affected, the condition can become life-threatening. Treatment usually includes medications to keep your blood pressure low to reduce the strain on your aorta. Regular monitoring to check for damage progression is vital. Many people with Marfan syndrome eventually require preventive surgery to repair the aorta.",

        "Overview": "Median arcuate ligament syndrome, also called MALS, happens when the band of tissue in the upper belly area presses on the artery that sends blood to the stomach, spleen and liver. This tissue is called the median arcuate ligament. The artery is called the celiac artery. The median arcuate ligament creates a pathway between the chest and belly area for the body's main blood vessel, called the aorta. Typically, the ligament goes across the aorta. The celiac artery sits just below the arch. But sometimes, the ligament or arteries may be out of place. The ligament may put pressure on the celiac artery and the network of surrounding nerves, called the celiac plexus. This pressure can cause the symptoms ofMALS. The condition can cause serious stomach pain in some people. MALScan occur in anyone, even children. Other names forMALSare: Treatment involves surgery to release pressure from the ligament on the artery and nerves.",

It is involved in muscle coordination, balance and movement. Medulloblastoma begins as a growth of cells, which is called a tumor. The cells grow quickly and can spread to other parts of the brain. Medulloblastoma cells tend to spread through the fluid that surrounds and protects your brain and spinal cord. This is called cerebrospinal fluid. Medulloblastomas don't usually spread to other parts of the body. Medulloblastoma can happen at any age, but most often occurs in young children. Though medulloblastoma is rare, it's the most common cancerous brain tumor in children. Medulloblastoma happens more often in families that have a history of conditions that increase the risk of cancer. These syndromes include Gorlin syndrome or Turcot syndrome.",

Rarely, it can happen inside the body, such as in the nose or throat. The exact cause of all melanomas isn't clear. Most melanomas are caused by exposure to ultraviolet light. Ultraviolet light, also called UV light, comes from sunlight or tanning lamps and beds. Limiting exposure toUVlight can help reduce the risk of melanoma. The risk of melanoma seems to be increasing in people under 40, especially women. Knowing the symptoms of skin cancer can help ensure that cancerous changes are detected and treated before the cancer has spread. Melanoma can be treated successfully if it is found early.",

Decreased blood flow can permanently damage the small intestine. Sudden loss of blood flow to the small intestine is called acute mesenteric ischemia. The acute type is often caused by a blood clot and needs immediate treatment, such as surgery. Mesenteric ischemia that develops over time is called chronic mesenteric ischemia. The chronic type is usually caused by a buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries. Chronic mesenteric ischemia is treated with open surgery or a procedure called angioplasty. Chronic mesenteric ischemia can become acute if it's not treated. It also can lead to severe weight loss and malnutrition.",

This buildup is caused by a deficiency of an enzyme that helps break down lipids called sulfatides. The brain and nervous system progressively lose function because the substance that covers and protects the nerve cells (myelin) is damaged. There are three forms of metachromatic leukodystrophy, which involve different age ranges: late infantile form, juvenile form and adult form. Signs and symptoms can vary. The infantile form is the most common and progresses more rapidly than the other forms. There is no cure for metachromatic leukodystrophy yet. Depending on the form and age of onset, early identification and treatment may help manage some signs and symptoms and delay progression of the disorder.",

        "Overview": "Mood disorders, such as depression and bipolar disorder, affect people emotionally. If you have depression, you may constantly feel sad. You also may be anxious. If you have bipolar disorder, you'll likely have extreme mood swings. Your feelings may range from being very sad, empty or cranky to being very happy — going back and forth between each mood. Mood disorders are more common in women. Having a mood disorder may raise your risk of suicide. This risk is higher if the mood disorder is serious and you also have problems with alcohol or drugs. If you're thinking about suicide, contact a hotline for help. In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. It's available 24 hours a day, every day. Or use theLifeline Chat. Services are free and private. The Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in the U.S. has a Spanish-language phone line at 1-888-628-9454 (toll-free). Mood disorders are divided into two major groups: depressive disorders and bipolar disorders. Each group includes several different types. Depressive disorders cause loss of pleasure in most or all activities and ultimately affect your quality of life. You could have less energy, trouble sleeping, trouble concentrating, changes in appetite and lack interest. You also could have feelings of worthlessness or guilt and be in pain and tired. Types of depressive disorders include: Bipolar disorders feature mood swings that include emotional highs called manic or hypomanic episodes, and lows, called depressive episodes. These highs and lows are usually continuous. But they also can change from high to low or low to high — or shift into a normal mood. Sometimes both the highs and lows might occur together. This is called a mixed episode. You could be easily distracted and have racing thoughts. Your sleep also could be affected. Types include:",

        "Overview": "Multiple sclerosis is a disease that causes breakdown of the protective covering of nerves. Multiple sclerosis can cause numbness, weakness, trouble walking, vision changes and other symptoms. It's also known as MS. In MS, the immune system attacks the protective sheath that covers nerve fibers, known as myelin. This interrupts communication between the brain and the rest of the body. Eventually, the disease can cause permanent damage of the nerve fibers. Symptoms of MS depend on the person, the location of damage in the nervous system and how bad the damage is to the nerve fibers. Some people lose the ability to walk on their own or move at all. Others may have long periods between attacks without any new symptoms, called remission. The course of the disease varies depending on the type of MS. There's no cure for multiple sclerosis. However, there are treatments to help speed the recovery from attacks, modify the course of the disease and manage symptoms. Some conditions are classified as stages, but multiple sclerosis is classified as types. MS types depend on the progression of symptoms and frequency of relapses. Types of MS include: Most people with multiple sclerosis have the relapsing-remitting type. They experience periods of new symptoms or relapses that develop over days or weeks and usually improve partially or completely. These relapses are followed by quiet periods of disease remission that can last months or even years. At least 20% to 40% of people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis can eventually develop a steady progression of symptoms. This progression may come with or without periods of remission and happens within 10 to 40 years of disease onset. This is known as secondary-progressive MS. The worsening of symptoms usually includes trouble with mobility and walking. The rate of disease progression varies greatly among people with secondary-progressive MS. Some people with multiple sclerosis experience a gradual onset and steady progression of signs and symptoms without any relapses. This type of MS is known as primary-progressive MS. Clinically isolated syndrome refers to the first episode of a condition that affects the myelin. After further testing, clinically isolated syndrome may be diagnosed as MS or a different condition. Radiologically isolated syndrome refers to findings on MRIs of the brain and spinal cord that look like MS in someone without classic symptoms of MS.",

The difference between a strain and a sprain is that a strain involves an injury to a muscle or to the band of tissue that attaches a muscle to a bone, while a sprain injures the bands of tissue that connect two bones together. Initial treatment includes rest, ice, compression and elevation. Mild strains can be successfully treated at home. Severe strains sometimes require surgical repair.",

Sometimes it's caused by another blood cell condition. When this happens, it's called secondary myelofibrosis. Some people with myelofibrosis have no symptoms and might not need treatment right away. Others with more-serious forms of the disease might need treatment. Treatment for myelofibrosis typically focuses on relieving symptoms. Myelofibrosis belongs to a group of cancers called myeloproliferative neoplasms. These cancers cause the body to make too many blood cells that don't work right. Myelofibrosis and the other myeloproliferative neoplasms can lead to different types of leukemia. Leukemia is cancer that affects the blood-forming tissues in the body.",

But behind this mask of extreme confidence, they are not sure of their self-worth and are easily upset by the slightest criticism. A narcissistic personality disorder causes problems in many areas of life, such as relationships, work, school or financial matters. People with narcissistic personality disorder may be generally unhappy and disappointed when they're not given the special favors or admiration that they believe they deserve. They may find their relationships troubled and unfulfilling, and other people may not enjoy being around them. Treatment for narcissistic personality disorder centers around talk therapy, also called psychotherapy. Narcissistic personality disorder affects more males than females, and it often begins in the teens or early adulthood. Some children may show traits of narcissism, but this is often typical for their age and doesn't mean they'll go on to develop narcissistic personality disorder.",

Nasopharyngeal (nay-zoh-fuh-RIN-jee-ul) carcinoma is rare in the United States. It happens much more often in other parts of the world, mainly Southeast Asia. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is hard to find early. That's most likely because the nasopharynx isn't easy to examine. And there may be no symptoms at first. Treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma usually involves radiation therapy, chemotherapy or a mix of the two. Work with your healthcare professional to find the approach that's right for you.",

Myopia happens when the shape of the eye — or the shape of certain parts of the eye — causes light rays to bend or refract. Light rays that should be focused on nerve tissues at the back of the eye, called the retina, are focused in front of the retina instead. Nearsightedness usually develops during childhood and adolescence. Typically, it becomes more stable between the ages of 20 and 40. It tends to run in families. A basic eye exam can confirm nearsightedness. You can correct the blurry vision with eyeglasses, contact lenses or refractive surgery.",

Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis can also affect internal organs, such as the heart and lungs, and it can cause a disabling shortening of muscles and tendons in the joints (joint contracture). For some people with advanced kidney disease, being exposed to older gadolinium-based contrast agents (group 1) during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other imaging studies has been identified as a trigger for development of this disease. Recognition of this link has dramatically reduced the incidence of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Newer gadolinium-based contrast agents (group 2) are not associated with an increased risk of systemic nephrogenic fibrosis.",

Neuroblastoma most often starts in the neuroblasts in the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are located on top of each kidney. The glands make hormones that control important functions in the body. Other cancers and tumors can happen in the adrenal glands, such as pheochromocytomas. These are different from neuroblastomas but may cause similar symptoms. Neuroblastoma can happen in other parts of the body that have neuroblasts, such as in the spine, belly, chest and neck. It also can affect other places in the body if it spreads. When the cancer spreads, it's called metastatic neuroblastoma. Neuroblastoma mostly affects children age 5 or younger. Symptoms vary, depending on where it occurs in the body. Some forms of neuroblastoma may go away on their own. Other forms of neuroblastoma need treatment. Treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and bone marrow transplant. Your child's healthcare team will select the neuroblastoma treatments that are best for your child. Neuroblastoma is different from other cancers that have similar names, such as glioblastoma and nephroblastoma, also called Wilms tumor. All of these names contain the term \"blastoma,\" which means a cancer or tumor that's made up of blasts. Blasts are cells that haven't fully developed yet. Neuroblastoma starts in nerve cells that are in the blast stage, called neuroblasts.",

But the itching can be so intense it disrupts your sleep, sexual function and quality of life. Breaking the itch-scratch cycle of neurodermatitis is challenging, and neurodermatitis is usually a long-term condition. It may clear up with treatment but often returns.

There are many types of neuroendocrine tumors. Some grow slowly and some grow very quickly. Some are functional neuroendocrine tumors, which means they make excess hormones. Others are nonfunctional neuroendocrine tumors, which means they don't release hormones or don't release enough to cause symptoms. Diagnosis and treatment of neuroendocrine tumors depend on various factors. These include the type of tumor, its location, whether it produces excess hormones, how aggressive it is and whether it has spread to other parts of the body. Some people wonder if neuroendocrine tumors are related to adenocarcinoma.Adenocarcinomais cancer that starts in gland cells. Adenocarcinomas are similar to neuroendocrine tumors in that they can happen just about anywhere in the body. But they are different types of cancer that behave differently. For example, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors tend to grow more slowly than pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have a better prognosis.",

The more you use smoked tobacco, the more nicotine you need to feel good. When you try to stop, you go through mental and physical changes that aren't pleasant. These are symptoms of nicotine withdrawal. For some people, using any amount of smoked tobacco can quickly lead to nicotine dependence. But no matter how long you've used nicotine, stopping can improve your health. It isn't easy, but you can break your dependence on nicotine. There are treatment options. Ask your healthcare professional for help.",

The conditions affect the body's ability to break down and use fats, such as cholesterol and lipids, inside cells. Because of the buildup of fats, these cells don't work as they should and, over time, the cells die. Niemann-Pick disease can affect the brain, nerves, liver, spleen and bone marrow. Sometimes it can affect the lungs. Symptoms of Niemann-Pick disease relate to worsening function of the nerves, brain and other organs over time. Niemann-Pick disease can happen at different ages but mainly affects children. The condition has no known cure and is sometimes fatal.

In MASLD, too much fat builds up in the liver. MASLD is becoming more common, especially in Middle Eastern and Western nations, as the number of people with obesity rises. It is the most common form of liver disease in the world. MASLD ranges in severity from hepatic steatosis — sometimes called diffuse hepatic steatosis, or formerly fatty liver infiltration or simply fatty liver — to a more severe form of disease called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), formerly called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). MASH causes the liver to swell or enlarge. This is known ashepatomegaly. MASH also causes fat deposits in the liver, which causes liver damage. MASH may get worse and may lead to serious liver scarring, calledcirrhosis, or even liver cancer. This damage is like the damage caused by heavy alcohol use. Life expectancyvaries depending on whether you have MASLD or MASH. Factors such as scarring and other health conditions also affect how long you can live with MASLD or MASH.",

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma happens when germ-fighting cells in the lymphatic system grow out of control. The cells can form growths, called tumors, throughout the body. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a broad group of lymphomas. There are many subtypes in this group. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma are among the most common subtypes. The other broad group of lymphoma is Hodgkin lymphoma. Advances in diagnosis and treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma have helped improve the prognosis for people with this condition.",

A child inherits a copy of an affected gene from a parent. This is called dominant inheritance. The condition also can occur as a spontaneous change. This means there's no family history involved. Doctors manage Noonan syndrome by controlling the symptoms and complications. They may use a growth hormone to treat short height in some people with Noonan syndrome.",

These substances can trigger an immune system response that changes how the lungs work. Occupational asthma also is called work-related asthma. In asthma, the airways narrow and swell. They also may make extra mucus. This makes it difficult to breathe and may cause chest tightness, wheezing and shortness of breath. Avoiding triggers is important for managing occupational asthma. Treatment includes medicines that reduce symptoms. For people who were diagnosed with asthma in the past, medicines may help improve symptoms related to workplace triggers. If occupational asthma is not treated and triggers are not avoided, the asthma can cause permanent changes to the lungs.",

Oligodendroglioma comes from cells that support the nerve cells, not the nerve cells themselves. Oligodendroglioma usually forms in the brain. More rarely, it can form in the spinal cord. As the tumor grows, it can press on brain or spinal cord tissue and cause symptoms. Symptoms depend on which part of the brain or spinal cord is affected. Oligodendrogliomas are rare. They are most common in adults, but they can happen at any age. Most of the time, this tumor grows slowly. Symptoms include seizures, headaches, and weakness or disability in a part of the body. Treatment is with surgery, when possible. Sometimes surgery can't be done if the tumor is in a place that makes it hard to reach with surgical tools. Other treatments may be needed if the tumor can't be removed or if it's likely to come back after surgery. If you are diagnosed with oligodendroglioma, your healthcare team likely will monitor the tumor, even after treatment.",

It can cause symptoms either after an injury to a joint or after several months of activity, especially high-impact activity such as jumping and running, that affects the joint. The condition occurs most commonly in the knee, but also occurs in elbows, ankles and other joints. Doctors stage osteochondritis dissecans according to the size of the injury, whether the fragment is partially or completely detached, and whether the fragment stays in place. If the loosened piece of cartilage and bone stays in place, you may have few or no symptoms. For young children whose bones are still developing, the injury might heal by itself. Surgery might be necessary if the fragment comes loose and gets caught between the moving parts of your joint or if you have persistent pain.",

Osteoporosis-related breaks most commonly occur in the hip, wrist or spine. Bone is living tissue that is constantly being broken down and replaced. Osteoporosis occurs when the creation of new bone doesn't keep up with the loss of old bone. Osteoporosis affects people of all races. But women who are white or of Asian descent, especially older women who are past menopause, are at highest risk. Medicines, healthy diet and weight-bearing exercise can help prevent bone loss or strengthen already weak bones.",

When panic attacks occur, you might think you're losing control, having a heart attack or even dying. Many people have just one or two panic attacks in their lifetimes, and the problem goes away, perhaps when a stressful situation ends. But if you've had recurrent, unexpected panic attacks and spent long periods in constant fear of another attack, you may have a condition called panic disorder. Although panic attacks themselves aren't life-threatening, they can be frightening and significantly affect your quality of life. But treatment can be very effective.",

A paraganglioma is rare. And most often, it's not cancer. When a tumor isn't cancer, it's called benign. Sometimes a paraganglioma is cancerous. A cancerous tumor can spread to other parts of the body. Paragangliomas often don't have a clear cause. Some paragangliomas are caused by DNA changes that pass from parents to children. Paragangliomas can form at any age. Healthcare professionals most often find them in adults between the ages of 20 and 50. Paraganglioma treatment typically involves surgery to remove the tumor. If the paraganglioma is cancerous and spreads to other areas of the body, more treatments may be needed.",

Depending on where the nervous system is affected, paraneoplastic syndromes can affect muscle movement, coordination, sensory perception, memory, thinking skills or even sleep. Sometimes the injury to the nervous system can be reversed with therapy directed toward the cancer and the immune system. But sometimes paraneoplastic syndromes can result in permanent damage to the nervous system.

The nervous system is a network of nerve cells that controls many parts of the body, including movement. Symptoms start slowly. The first symptom may be a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand or sometimes a foot or the jaw. Tremor is common in Parkinson's disease. But the disorder also may cause stiffness, slowing of movement and trouble with balance that raises the risk of falls. In the early stages of Parkinson's disease, your face may show little or no expression. Your arms may not swing when you walk. Your speech may become soft or slurred. Symptoms get worse over time. Although Parkinson's disease can't be cured, medicines may help symptoms get better. Sometimes a healthcare professional may suggest surgery to help control parts of the brain. This surgery may help lessen symptoms.",

It also can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, and a fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heart. The symptoms tend to become worse during the teenage growth spurt. The exact cause of pectus excavatum isn't clear. When the condition is serious, it can affect how well the heart and lungs work over time. But even mild pectus excavatum that causes a slight dip in the breastbone can make children feel self-conscious about their bodies. Surgery to repair pectus excavatum can improve symptoms and the appearance of the chest. But surgery isn't right for everyone with the condition. Other treatment choices may include physical therapy and medical devices.",

This can cause symptoms, such as headaches and nausea. Many types of pediatric brain tumors exist. Some grow quickly, and some grow slowly. Some are cancerous, and some aren't cancerous. Noncancerous brain tumors also are called benign brain tumors. The type of brain tumor a child has helps determine the best treatment plan. Other things your child's healthcare team considers include the tumor's location, whether it has spread beyond the brain, and your child's age and overall health. Treatment for brain tumors in children is often quite different from treatment for adult brain tumors. For this reason, seek out care at a medical center that has experience caring for children with brain tumors.",

        "Overview": "Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea is a condition in which a child's breathing is partly or completely blocked during sleep. Breathing can briefly stop and start again many times a night. The condition happens when the upper airway narrows or is blocked during sleep. Obstructive sleep apnea can look different in children than it does in adults. Adults usually have daytime sleepiness. Children are more likely to have behavior issues, such as acting hyper or not paying attention. Risk factors also differ. In adults, the key risk factors are obesity and age. Although obesity can play a role in children, the main risk factor in children is having tonsils and adenoids that are larger than usual. The adenoids are two small pads of tissue in the back of the nose. The tonsils are two oval-shaped pads in the back of the mouth. It's important for healthcare professionals to find and treat pediatric obstructive sleep apnea as soon as possible. Early treatment helps prevent other health conditions called complications. These can affect children's growth, learning, behavior and heart health. The first treatment may be surgery to remove enlarged tonsils and adenoids. But some children may get better using medical devices or taking medicines.",

Healthcare professionals have ways to clear out the infection. They also can treat any medical problem that might be causing it. Peritonitis treatment usually involves medicines that are used for infections caused by bacteria, called antibiotics. Some people with peritonitis need surgery. If you don't get treatment, peritonitis can lead to a serious infection that spreads through the body. It can be deadly. A common cause of peritonitis is a treatment for kidney failure called peritoneal dialysis. This treatment helps get rid of waste products from the blood when the kidneys struggle to do that job themselves. If you get peritoneal dialysis, you can help prevent peritonitis with good hygiene before, during and after dialysis. For example, it's important to wash your hands and clean the skin around your catheter.",

But Peyronie's disease causes a serious bend or pain in some people. This can prevent you from having sex. Or it might make it hard to get or keep an erection, which also is called erectile dysfunction. For many people, Peyronie's disease also causes stress and anxiety. Peyronie's disease rarely goes away on its own. In most people with the condition, it will remain as is or may get slightly worse early on. Early treatment soon after you get the condition may keep it from getting worse or even improve symptoms. Even if you've had Peyronie's disease for some time, treatment may help ease symptoms such as pain, curving and shortening.",

This gene helps create the enzyme needed to break down phenylalanine. Without the enzyme necessary to break down phenylalanine, a dangerous buildup can develop when a person withPKUeats foods that contain protein or eats aspartame, an artificial sweetener. This can eventually lead to serious health problems. For the rest of their lives, people withPKU— babies, children and adults — need to follow a diet that limits phenylalanine, which is found mostly in foods that contain protein. Newer medications may allow some people withPKUto eat a diet that has a higher or an unrestricted amount of phenylalanine. Babies in the United States and many other countries are screened forPKUsoon after birth. Although there is no cure forPKU, recognizingPKUand starting treatment right away can help prevent limitations in areas of thinking, understanding and communicating (intellectual disability) and major health problems.",

You have two adrenal glands — one at the top of each kidney. The adrenal glands make hormones that help control key processes in the body, such as blood pressure. Usually, a pheochromocytoma forms in only one adrenal gland. But tumors can grow in both adrenal glands. With a pheochromocytoma, the tumor releases hormones that can cause various symptoms. They include high blood pressure, headache, sweating and symptoms of a panic attack. If a pheochromocytoma isn't treated, serious or life-threatening damage to other body systems can happen. Surgery to remove a pheochromocytoma often returns blood pressure to a healthy range.",

        "Overview": "Pilocytic astrocytoma (py-loh-SIT-ik as-troh-sih-TOH-muh) is a slow-growing brain tumor that usually affects children and teens. The term \"pilocytic\" refers to the cells' long, hairlike shape as seen under a microscope. The term \"astrocytoma\" means the tumor starts in star-shaped brain cells called astrocytes. Pilocytic astrocytoma is a type of brain tumor called glioma, which begins in a glial cell. Glial cells support and protect nerve cells in the brain and help them function properly. Pilocytic astrocytoma grows from a type of glial cell called an astrocyte. Astrocytes help keep the brain working smoothly. They maintain the right conditions around brain cells by managing chemicals, fluids and waste. They also support communication between neurons. Pilocytic astrocytoma is the most common type of glioma in children. Pilocytic astrocytoma often develops in the part of the brain that controls movement and balance, called the cerebellum. These tumors also can appear in other structures including the optic nerve, brainstem, spinal cord or other parts of the brain. Most pilocytic astrocytomas are noncancerous, also called benign. Symptoms depend on the tumor's location but may include headaches, nausea, balance problems, vision changes or behavior changes. Pilocytic astrocytomas are classified as grade 1 tumors by the World Health Organization (WHO) scale for brain tumors. Grade 1 tumors are considered the least aggressive brain tumors. Grade 1 indicates that the tumor: Pilocytic astrocytomas were previously called juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma (JPA) because the condition is more common in children. Currently, pilocytic astrocytoma is the term used for both adults and children with the condition. Treatment for pilocytic astrocytoma usually involves surgery to remove the tumor. If the tumor can be completely removed, no other treatment may be needed. When the tumor can't be fully removed or it grows back, other treatments such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy or radiation may be used. The prognosis for people with pilocytic astrocytoma is usually very good, especially when the tumor is found early and can be fully removed.",

Some of these tumors cause the pituitary gland to make too much of certain hormones that control important body functions. Others can cause the pituitary gland to make too little of those hormones. Most pituitary tumors are benign. That means they are not cancer. Another name for these noncancerous tumors is pituitary adenomas. Most adenomas stay in the pituitary gland or in the tissue around it, and they grow slowly. They typically don't spread to other parts of the body. Pituitary tumors can be treated in several ways. The tumor may be removed with surgery. Or its growth may be controlled with medications or radiation therapy. Sometimes, hormone levels are managed with medicine. Your health care provider may suggest a combination of these treatments. In some cases, observation — also called a ''wait-and-see'' approach — may be the right choice. Types of pituitary adenomas include: Pituitary tumors are different from pituitary cysts. A cyst is a sac that may be filled with air, fluid or other material. A tumor is an unusual mass of cells that may grow over time. Cysts may form on or near the pituitary gland, but they are not tumors or adenomas.",

Also called pleuritis, pleurisy causes sharp chest pain (pleuritic pain) that worsens during breathing. One pleural layer of tissue wraps around the outside of the lungs. The other pleural layer lines the inner chest wall. Between these two layers is a small space (pleural space) that's usually filled with a very small amount of liquid. These layers act like two pieces of smooth satin gliding past each other, allowing your lungs to expand and contract when you breathe. If you have pleurisy, these tissues swell and become inflamed. As a result, the two layers of the pleural lining rub against each other like two pieces of sandpaper. This causes pain when you breathe in and out. The pleuritic pain lessens or stops when you hold your breath. Treatment of pleurisy involves pain control and treating the cause.",

        "Overview": "Plexiform neurofibroma also is called PN or PNF. It is a type of noncancerous tumor called neurofibroma that forms in or around a nerve. Neurofibromas grow on the protective covering around the nerve, called the nerve sheath. When a neurofibroma grows on several nerve bundles, it's called a plexiform neurofibroma. The tumor grows along the nerve and can spread into nearby tissues such as skin, fat, bone and muscle. Plexiform neurofibroma is most often seen in people with a condition caused by a change in genes that affects how nerve cells grow and develop, called neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Up to half of the people with NF1 develop plexiform neurofibromas. Plexiform neurofibromas are different from other nerve tumors because they spread out in a networklike pattern. These tumors are known for their distinctive \"bag of worms\" texture, which means they feel like a bundle of tangled cords or threads. This is a classic sign of a plexiform neurofibroma. Plexiform neurofibromas are most common in childhood and adolescence. Some people may notice swelling or a soft lump under the skin. These tumors often grow in the head, neck, trunk, arms or legs, but they can appear anywhere in the body. Treatment depends on the size, location and symptoms of the plexiform neurofibroma. Most plexiform neurofibromas grow slowly and are not life-threatening. But some can cause serious symptoms depending on the size or location or if they become cancerous.",

This oil is in the leaves, stems and roots of poison ivy, poison oak and poison sumac. Wash your skin right away if you come into contact with this oil, unless you know you're not sensitive to it. Washing off the oil may reduce your chances of getting a poison ivy rash. If you develop a rash, it can be very itchy and last for weeks. You can treat mild cases of poison ivy rash at home with soothing lotions and cool baths. You may need prescription medication for a rash that's severe or widespread — especially if it's on your face or genitals.",

The disease also is called poliomyelitis. A vaccination effort throughout the world has led to only a small number of cases to occur around the world in recent years. But poliovirus still spreads within areas with low vaccination rates. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes travel notices of countries where there is a higher risk of polio. Countries at a higher risk of polio are generally in Africa, the Middle East, and southern and central Asia. Vaccinated adults who plan to travel to an area where polio is spreading should get a booster dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). Immunity after a booster lasts a lifetime.",

They are not cancer. In PKD, the cysts vary in size. They can grow very large. Having many cysts or large cysts can damage the kidneys. Polycystic kidney disease also can cause cysts to grow in the liver, the pancreas and other places in the body. The disease can cause serious complications, including high blood pressure and kidney failure. PKD varies greatly in how bad it is. It's possible to prevent some complications.

Eight enzymes are needed to change porphyrins into heme. Without enough of any of these enzymes, porphyrins build up in the body. High levels of porphyrins can cause major problems, mainly in the nervous system and skin. There are two general types of porphyrias. Acute porphyrias start rapidly and mainly affect the nervous system. Cutaneous porphyrias mainly affect the skin. A few types of porphyrias affect both the nervous system and the skin. Symptoms of porphyria vary, depending on the specific type of porphyria and how severe it is. Porphyria is usually inherited. One or both parents pass along a changed gene to their child. Although porphyria can't be cured, medicines and certain lifestyle changes may help you manage it. Treatment for symptoms depends on the type of porphyria you have.",

Over time this condition may cause a decline in memory and thinking abilities, known as cognitive skills. Posterior cortical atrophy causes the loss of brain cells in back of the brain. This is the region responsible for visual processing and spatial reasoning. This changes a person's ability to process visual and spatial information.

        "Overview": "A posterior vaginal prolapse is a bulge of tissue into the vagina. It happens when the tissue between the rectum and the vagina weakens or tears. This causes the rectum to push into the vaginal wall. Posterior vaginal prolapse is also called a rectocele (REK-toe-seel). Childbirth-related tears, chronic straining to pass stool (constipation) and other activities that put pressure on pelvic tissues can lead to posterior vaginal prolapse. A small prolapse might not cause symptoms. With a large prolapse, you might notice a bulge of tissue that pushes through the opening of the vagina. To pass stool, you might need to support the vaginal wall with your fingers. This is called splinting. The bulge can be uncomfortable, but it's rarely painful. If needed, self-care measures and other nonsurgical options are often effective. For severe posterior vaginal prolapse, you might need surgery to fix it.",

Baby blues usually begin within the first 2 to 3 days after delivery and may last for up to two weeks. But some new moms experience a more severe, long-lasting form of depression known as postpartum depression. Sometimes it's called peripartum depression because it can start during pregnancy and continue after childbirth. Rarely, an extreme mood disorder called postpartum psychosis also may develop after childbirth. Postpartum depression is not a character flaw or a weakness. Sometimes it's simply a complication of giving birth. If you have postpartum depression, prompt treatment can help you manage your symptoms and help you bond with your baby.",

Bile is a fluid made in the liver. It helps with digestion and absorbing certain vitamins. It also helps the body absorb fats and get rid of cholesterol, toxins and worn-out red blood cells. Ongoing inflammation in the liver can lead to bile duct inflammation and damage known as cholangitis. At times, this can lead to permanent scarring of liver tissue, called cirrhosis. It also can eventually lead to liver failure. Although it affects both sexes, primary biliary cholangitis mostly affects women. It's considered an autoimmune disease, which means your body's immune system is mistakenly attacking healthy cells and tissue. Researchers think a combination of genetic and environmental factors triggers the disease. It usually develops slowly. At this time, there's no cure for primary biliary cholangitis, but medicines may slow liver damage, especially if treatment begins early.",

        "Overview": "Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare, long-term disease of the liver caused by inflammation of tubes in the liver called bile ducts. Scarring and narrowing of bile ducts leads to liver damage. Over time, the liver loses its ability to filter blood and support digestion. PSC is rare, affecting up to 1 in 10,000 people. PSC often is linked withinflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especiallyulcerative colitis. People with PSC are at higher risk of liver failure and cancers of the bile ducts, gallbladder and colon. Care focuses on monitoring liver health and managing symptoms. Procedures can temporarily open blocked ducts, but liver transplant is the only cure for advanced disease. Other bile duct conditions may look similar but are different: Researchers believe PSC is an immune-mediated condition in which the immune system attacks healthy tissues. Another related condition,primary biliary cholangitis, mainly damages the smaller bile ducts inside the liver, occurs mostly in women and often responds to medicines.",

Instead, some blood travels to the lungs through other natural passages within the heart and its arteries. A baby in the womb needs these other passages. But they usually close soon after birth.

The scarring that happens in pulmonary fibrosis can be caused by many things. Often, doctors and other healthcare professionals cannot pinpoint what's causing the problem. When a cause cannot be found, the condition is called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis usually occurs in middle-aged and older adults. Sometimes pulmonary fibrosis is diagnosed in children and infants, but this is not common. The lung damage caused by pulmonary fibrosis cannot be repaired. Medicines and therapies can sometimes help slow down the rate of fibrosis, ease symptoms and improve quality of life. For some people, a lung transplant might be an option.",

Pyloric stenosis usually leads to forceful vomiting, dehydration, poor nutrition and weight loss. Babies with pyloric stenosis may seem to be hungry all the time. Pyloric stenosis is treated with surgery. The passage between the stomach and small intestine is called the pylorus. The valve that controls the opening may be called the pyloric muscle, pyloric sphincter or pyloric valve. The enlargement of the pyloric muscle is called hypertrophy.

        "Overview": "Radiation sickness is damage to the body caused by a large dose of radiation often received over a short time. This is called acute radiation sickness. The amount of radiation absorbed by the body, called the absorbed dose, determines how bad the illness will be. Radiation sickness also is called acute radiation syndrome or radiation poisoning. Radiation sickness is not caused by common medical imaging tests that use low-dose radiation, such as X-rays, CT scans and nuclear medicine scans. Although radiation sickness is serious and often fatal, it's rare. Since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, during World War II, most cases of radiation sickness have occurred after nuclear industrial accidents, such as the 1986 fire that damaged the nuclear power plant at Chernobyl, Ukraine.",

This is mainly because the rectum is barely separated from other organs and structures. It sits in a tight space that can make surgery to remove rectal cancer complex. Rectal cancer treatment often involves surgery to remove the cancer. Other treatments may include chemotherapy, radiation or a combination of the two.

The brain interprets the signals as images. Retinoblastoma happens most often in young children. It's usually diagnosed before age 2. It most often affects one eye. Sometimes it happens in both eyes.

Upon release, the testicle will remain in the proper position at least temporarily. For most boys, the problem of a retractile testicle goes away sometime before or during puberty.

The need to scratch may be stronger at night. Scabies is contagious and can spread quickly through close person-to-person contact in a family, child care group, school class, nursing home or prison. Because scabies spreads so easily, health care providers often recommend treating the entire family or any close contacts. Scabies is easily treated. Medicated skin creams or pills kill the mites that cause scabies and their eggs. But itching may not stop for many weeks after treatment.",

It's very hard for the person to express a full range of emotions. If you have schizoid personality disorder, you may be seen as keeping to yourself or rejecting others. You may not be interested in or able to form close friendships or romantic relationships. Because you do not tend to show emotion, it may appear that you do not care about others or what's going on around you. Schizoid personality disorder is less common than other personality disorders, but it's much more common than schizophrenia. The cause is not known. Some symptoms of schizoid personality disorder are similar to autism spectrum disorders, other personality disorders — especially avoidant personality disorder — and early symptoms of schizophrenia. Talk therapy, also called psychotherapy, can help those who know they need to improve relationships with others. But it's common to feel unsure about change. Medicines are mainly used to treat mental health conditions that occur along with schizoid personality disorder, rather than the disorder itself.",

Delusions involve firm beliefs about things that are not true. People with schizophrenia can seem to lose touch with reality, which can make daily living very hard. People with schizophrenia need lifelong treatment. This includes medicine, talk therapy and help in learning how to manage daily life activities. Because many people with schizophrenia don't know they have a mental health condition and may not believe they need treatment, many research studies have examined the results of untreated psychosis. People who have psychosis that is not treated often have more-severe symptoms, more stays in a hospital, poorer thinking and processing skills and social outcomes, injuries, and even death. On the other hand, early treatment often helps control symptoms before serious complications arise, making the long-term outlook better.",

They also can grow on peripheral nerves, which are nerves located outside of the brain and spinal cord. Schwannomatosis is rare. It's usually diagnosed in early adulthood. There are three types of schwannomatosis. Each type is caused by an altered gene. In NF2-related schwannomatosis (NF2), tumors grow in both ears and can cause hearing loss. The altered gene that causes this type is sometimes passed down from a parent. NF2-related schwannomatosis was previously known as neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2). The other two types of schwannomatosis are SMARCB1-related schwannomatosis and LZTR1-related schwannomatosis. The altered genes that cause these types usually are not passed down through families. The tumors caused by schwannomatosis usually are not cancerous. Symptoms can include headaches, hearing loss, trouble with balance and pain. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms.",

This causes inflammation, pain and often some numbness in the affected leg. Although the pain associated with sciatica can be serious, those cases that are caused by a herniated disk can clear up with treatment in a few weeks to months.

If the curve gets very bad, scoliosis can cause pain and breathing problems. A bad curve of the spine can push on the lungs and make it hard to breathe. Healthcare professionals watch growing children who have mild scoliosis with follow-up visits a few times a year. This most often involves X-rays and a physical exam to see if the curve is getting worse. Many people with scoliosis don't need treatment. Some children may need to wear a brace to stop the curve from getting worse. Others may need surgery to correct the curves.",

        "Overview": "Scorpion stings are painful but rarely life-threatening. Healthy adults usually don't need treatment for scorpion stings. Young children and older adults are most at risk of serious complications. Scorpions are arthropods — a relative of insects, spiders and crustaceans. Bark scorpions — the only scorpion species in the U.S. with venom strong enough to cause serious symptoms — are generally about 1.6 to 3 inches (4 to 8 cm) long, including a segmented tail with a stinger that can deliver venom. They're found mainly in the desert Southwest. Worldwide, of more than 2,000 species of scorpions, about 100 produce venom serious enough to be fatal. Scorpions have eight legs and a pair of lobster-like pinchers and a tail that curves up. They're generally more active at night. They usually won't sting unless provoked or attacked. Most stings occur when they're accidentally grabbed or stepped on or brushed against the body.",

They have a range of symptoms and vary in how much they affect your daily life. Seizure types also vary by where they begin in the brain and how far they spread. Most seizures last from 30 seconds to two minutes. A seizure that lasts longer than five minutes is a medical emergency. Seizures can happen after a stroke or a head injury. An infection such as meningitis or another illness also may be the cause. But often the cause is not known. Medicine can manage most seizures, but they can have side effects.

An immunoglobulin is an antibody produced by immune system cells to fight bacteria, parasites and other agents that cause illness. IgA antibodies circulate in the blood and are found in tears, saliva, breast milk, and fluids released from the lining of the airways, lungs and digestive system. Most people with selective IgA deficiency have no symptoms. But some people who have selective IgA deficiency have frequent illness of the airways, lungs and digestive system. Selective IgA deficiency may increase the risk of other conditions related to the immune system, such as allergies, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases and others.

In some children, intense and ongoing separation anxiety is a sign of a more serious condition known as separation anxiety disorder. Separation anxiety disorder can be identified as early as preschool age. Your child may have separation anxiety disorder if separation anxiety seems more intense than other kids of the same age or lasts a longer time, interferes with school or other daily activities, or includes panic attacks or other problem behaviors. Most often, separation anxiety relates to the child's anxiety about being away from parents or guardians, but it could relate to another close caregiver. Less often, separation anxiety disorder can occur in teenagers and adults. This can cause major problems leaving home or going to work. Treatment can lessen separation anxiety disorder symptoms. Treatment may include specific types of therapy, sometimes along with medicine.",

Your immune system is how your body protects itself, so it produces immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to protect against this allergen.

This causes a reaction that leads to the symptoms of an allergic reaction."

Some people with shellfish allergy react to all shellfish, while others react to only certain kinds. Reactions range from mild symptoms — such as hives or a stuffy nose — to severe and even life-threatening. If you think you have shellfish allergy, talk to your health care provider. Tests can help confirm the allergy so you can take steps to avoid future reactions.",

The condition often accompanies other immune system disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. In Sjogren's syndrome, the mucous membranes and moisture-secreting glands of your eyes and mouth are usually affected first — resulting in decreased tears and saliva. Although you can develop Sjogren's syndrome at any age, most people are older than 40 at the time of diagnosis. The condition is much more common in women. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms.",

Sometimes the cells break away and spread to other parts of the body. Many kinds of skin cancer exist. The most common skin cancers are basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. While these are the most common, they often can be cured. The most dangerous form of skin cancer is melanoma. It is more likely to spread, making it harder to cure. Most skin cancers happen on skin that gets a lot of sunlight. The light that comes from the sun is thought to cause most skin cancers. You can reduce your risk of skin cancer by covering your skin with clothes or sunscreen to protect it from the sun. Some skin cancers happen on skin that doesn't typically get sun. This likely means that something else is causing these cancers. To reduce your risk of these kinds of skin cancers, check your skin regularly for any changes. Report these changes to your healthcare professional.",

The base of the skull is where important blood vessels and nerves come together with the spinal cord. The base of the skull also separates the brain from the neck. Tumors also may be called masses, growths or lesions. These tumors can grow inside or outside the skull. They may be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Some skull base tumors may not cause any symptoms, but others can cause symptoms that affect your senses, such as vision or hearing, and the way that your nervous system works. Even noncancerous skull base tumors can be dangerous. These tumors may press on the blood vessels, nerves and brain tissue in the skull base. This may lead to hearing loss, vision problems, dizziness and other issues that affect safety and well-being. Types of skull base tumors are characterized by whether they are cancerous or noncancerous, and where the tumors grow in the base of the skull. Some tumors start growing somewhere else in the body and expand into the skull base. There are many types of skull base tumors. Some of the more common types of noncancerous, also known as benign, skull base tumors include: Other rare types of benign skull base tumors include craniopharyngiomas, granular cell tumors and angiofibromas. Some of the more common types of cancerous, also known as malignant, skull tumors include:",

The small intestine also plays a role in the body's germ-fighting immune system. It contains cells that fight bacteria and viruses that enter the body through the mouth. Small bowel cancer treatment usually involves surgery to remove the cancer. Other treatments include chemotherapy and targeted therapy, which use medicines to kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy also may be used to shrink the cancer before surgery.",

The last case of naturally occurring smallpox was reported in 1977. Samples of smallpox virus have been kept for research purposes. And scientific advances have made it possible to create smallpox in a lab. This has led to concerns that smallpox could someday be used as a bioweapon. Vaccines can prevent smallpox, but because most people are unlikely to come in contact with smallpox naturally, routine vaccination isn't recommended. New antiviral medications can be used to treat people who develop smallpox.",

Nearly everyone snores now and then, but for some people it can be a chronic problem. Sometimes it may also indicate a serious health condition. In addition, snoring can be a nuisance to your partner. Lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, avoiding alcohol close to bedtime or sleeping on your side, can help stop snoring. In addition, medical devices and surgery are available that may reduce disruptive snoring. However, these aren't suitable or necessary for everyone who snores.",

        "Overview": "Spina bifida is a condition that occurs when the spine and spinal cord don't form properly. It's a type of neural tube defect. The neural tube is the structure in a developing embryo that later becomes the baby's brain and spinal cord and the tissues that enclose them. Typically, the neural tube forms early in pregnancy and closes by the 28th day after conception. In babies with spina bifida, a portion of the neural tube doesn't close all the way. This affects the spinal cord and bones of the spine. Spina bifida can range from being mild to causing serious disabilities. Symptoms depend on where on the spine the opening is located and how big it is. Symptoms also depend on whether the spinal cord and nerves are involved. When necessary, early treatment for spina bifida involves surgery. However, surgery doesn't always completely restore lost function. Spina bifida occurs in different types: spina bifida occulta, myelomeningocele (my-uh-lo-muh-NING-go-seel) or the very rare type, meningocele (muh-NING-go-seel). Occulta means hidden. Spina bifida occulta is the mildest and most common type. This type of spina bifida results in a small separation or gap in one or more of the bones of the spine, called vertebrae. Many people who have spina bifida occulta don't know they have it. It may be found during an imaging test such as an X-ray that is done for another reason. Myelomeningocele is the most serious type. It also is known as open spina bifida. The spinal canal is open along several vertebrae in the lower or middle back. Part of the spinal cord, including the spinal cord's protective covering and spinal nerves, push through this opening at birth, forming a sac on the baby's back. Tissues and nerves usually are exposed. This makes the baby prone to dangerous infections. This type also may cause loss of movement in the legs, and bladder and bowel dysfunction. This is a rare type of spina bifida. In this type, a sac of spinal fluid bulges through an opening in the spine. No nerves are affected and the spinal cord isn't in the fluid sac. Babies with meningocele may have some minor trouble with functioning, including with the bladder and bowels.",

        "Overview": "A spinal arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a tangle of blood vessels that forms on, in or near the spinal cord. This creates irregular connections between arteries and veins. Without treatment, this rare condition can cause lasting damage to the spinal cord. Oxygen-rich blood enters the spinal cord through arteries. The arteries usually branch into smaller blood vessels called capillaries. The spinal cord gets oxygen from the blood in the capillaries. Then the blood passes into veins and moves away from the spinal cord to the heart and lungs. But in a spinalAVM, the blood passes directly from the arteries to the veins. This change in blood flow means that the surrounding cells don't get the oxygen they need. This can cause cells in the spinal tissue to weaken or die. The tangled arteries and veins in a spinalAVMalso can burst and cause bleeding in the spinal cord. Sometimes, theAVMgets bigger as blood flow increases. TheAVMcan press on the spinal cord and cause weakness or other symptoms. You might not know you have a spinalAVMunless you have symptoms. The condition can be treated with surgery to stop or possibly reverse some of the spinal damage.",

Both procedures require a puncture of the membrane that surrounds the spinal cord and, in the lower spine, the lumbar and sacral nerve roots. During a spinal tap, a sample of cerebrospinal fluid is withdrawn from the spinal canal. During spinal anesthesia, medication is injected into the spinal canal to numb the nerves in the lower half of the body. If spinal fluid leaks through the tiny puncture site, you may develop a spinal headache. Most spinal headaches — also known as post-dural puncture headaches — resolve on their own with no treatment.

The stomach helps to break down and digest food. Stomach cancer can happen in any part of the stomach. In most of the world, stomach cancers happen in the main part of the stomach. This part is called the stomach body. In the United States, stomach cancer is more likely to start by the gastroesophageal junction. This is the part where the long tube that carries food you swallow meets the stomach. The tube that carries food to the stomach is called the esophagus. Where the cancer starts in the stomach is one factor health care providers think about when making a treatment plan. Other factors might include the cancer's stage and the type of cells involved. Treatment often includes surgery to remove the stomach cancer. Other treatments may be used before and after surgery. Stomach cancer treatment is most likely to be successful if the cancer is only in the stomach. The prognosis for people with small stomach cancers is quite good. Many can expect to be cured. Most stomach cancers are found when the disease is advanced and a cure is less likely. Stomach cancer that grows through the stomach wall or spreads to other parts of the body is harder to cure.",

With stuttering, the interruptions in flow happen often and cause problems for the speaker. Other names for stuttering are stammering and childhood-onset fluency disorder. People who stutter know what they want to say, but they have a hard time saying it. For example, they may repeat or stretch out a word, a syllable, or a consonant or vowel sound. Or they may pause during speech because they've reached a word or sound that's hard to get out. Stuttering is common among young children as a usual part of learning to speak. Some young children may stutter when their speech and language abilities aren't developed enough to keep up with what they want to say. Most children outgrow this type of stuttering, called developmental stuttering. But sometimes stuttering is a long-term condition that remains into adulthood. This type of stuttering can affect self-esteem and communicating with other people. Children and adults who stutter may be helped by treatments such as speech therapy, electronic devices to improve speech fluency or a form of mental health therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy.",

Sudden infant death syndrome also is known asSIDS. It is sometimes called crib death because infants often die in their cribs. The cause ofSIDSis unknown. But it may be caused by problems in the area of an infant's brain that controls breathing and waking up from sleep. Researchers have found some things that might put babies at higher risk. They've also found some things you can do to help protect your child fromSIDS. The most important action may be to place a baby on the back to sleep.",

It also can be passed to a baby during pregnancy and childbirth and sometimes through breastfeeding. After the infection happens, syphilis bacteria can stay in the body for many years without causing symptoms. But the infection can become active again. Without treatment, syphilis can damage the heart, brain or other organs. It can become life-threatening. Early syphilis can be cured, sometimes with a single shot of medicine called penicillin. That's why it's key to get a health care checkup as soon as you notice any symptoms of syphilis. All pregnant people should get tested for syphilis at their first prenatal checkup too.",

These fatty substances, called gangliosides, build up to toxic levels in the brain and spinal cord and affect the function of the nerve cells. In the most common and severe form of Tay-Sachs disease, signs and symptoms start to show up at about 3 to 6 months of age. As the disease progresses, development slows and muscles begin to weaken. Over time, this leads to seizures, vision and hearing loss, paralysis, and other major issues. Children with this form of Tay-Sachs disease typically live only a few years. Less commonly, some children have the juvenile form of Tay-Sachs disease and may live into their teen years. Rarely, some adults have a late-onset form of Tay-Sachs disease which is often less severe than forms that begin in childhood. If you have a family history of Tay-Sachs disease or if you're a member of a high-risk group and plan to have children, health care providers strongly recommend genetic testing and genetic counseling.",

The lymphatic system is made up of organs, glands, tubelike vessels and clusters of cells called lymph nodes. It's part of the body's germ-fighting immune system. T-cell lymphomas can affect lymph nodes, blood, bone marrow, and other tissues throughout the body, such as in the gastrointestinal system, liver, nasal cavity and skin. There are many types of lymphoma. Lymphoma types are often divided into two categories: Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. T-cell lymphomas are a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. There are many subtypes of T-cell lymphomas. T-cell lymphomas get their name from the kind of cell that makes up these cancers. These cancers start in germ-fighting white blood cells called T cells. T cells also are called T lymphocytes. Treatment for T-cell lymphomas may include a \"watch and wait\" approach, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, clinical trials, and bone marrow transplant, also called bone marrow stem cell transplant. There are many types of T-cell lymphomas, including: Healthcare professionals may describe T-cell lymphomas as either aggressive or indolent. Aggressive lymphomas grow quickly and may have more symptoms. Indolent lymphomas grow slowly and may not have symptoms at first. Treatments may vary depending on if the lymphoma is aggressive or indolent. Some indolent lymphomas can transform into aggressive lymphomas.",

Some people have jobs that involve repeated movements that can lead to tennis elbow. These include plumbers, painters, carpenters and butchers. However, often tennis elbow has no clear cause. The pain of tennis elbow occurs mainly where the tough, cord-like tissues of the forearm muscles attach to a bony bump on the outside of the elbow. The tissues are known as tendons. Pain can spread into the forearm and wrist. Rest, pain medicines and physical therapy often help relieve tennis elbow. People for whom these treatments don't help or who have symptoms that get in the way of daily living might have a procedure, such as a shot or surgery.",

It can happen at any age, but it happens most often between the ages of 15 and 45. The first sign of testicular cancer often is a bump or lump on a testicle. The cancer cells can grow quickly. They often spread outside the testicle to other parts of the body. Testicular cancer is highly treatable, even when it spreads to other parts of the body.

        "Overview": "Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a group of conditions in which there's pressure on blood vessels or nerves in the area between the neck and shoulder. This space is known as the thoracic outlet. Compression of the blood vessels and nerves can cause shoulder and neck pain. It also can cause numbness in the fingers. Common causes of thoracic outlet syndrome include trauma from a car accident, repetitive injuries from a job or sport, and pregnancy. Differences in anatomy, such as having an extra or irregular rib, also can cause TOS. Sometimes the cause of thoracic outlet syndrome is not known. Treatment often involves physical therapy and pain relief. Most people improve with these treatments. For some, surgery may be recommended.",

Most types grow slowly, though some types can be very aggressive. Most thyroid cancers can be cured with treatment. Thyroid cancer rates seem to be increasing.

Tongue cancer most often begins in the thin, flat cells that line the surface of the tongue, called squamous cells. Tongue cancer that starts in these cells is called squamous cell carcinoma. Your health care team considers the type of cancer cells when making a treatment plan. The team also considers the location and size of the cancer. Tongue cancer treatment typically involves surgery and radiation therapy. Other options might be chemotherapy and targeted therapy.",

With tongue-tie, an unusually short, thick or tight band of tissue (lingual frenulum) tethers the bottom of the tongue's tip to the floor of the mouth. Depending on how much the tissue restricts tongue movement, it may interfere with breastfeeding. Someone who has tongue-tie might have difficulty sticking out the tongue. Tongue-tie can also affect eating or speaking. Sometimes tongue-tie may not cause problems. Some cases may require a simple surgical procedure for correction.",

        "Overview": "A tonic-clonic seizure, previously known as a grand mal seizure, causes a loss of consciousness and violent muscle contractions. It's the type of seizure most people picture when they think about seizures. During a seizure, there's a burst of electrical activity in the brain that causes changes in behavior and movements. Seizures can be focal, meaning the burst of electrical activity happens in one area of the brain. Or seizures can be generalized, in which they result in electrical activity in all areas of the brain. Tonic-clonic seizures may begin as focal seizures in a small area of the brain and spread to become generalized seizures that involve the whole brain. Focal and generalized seizures have different symptoms. People who have generalized seizures usually lose consciousness. But people who have focal seizures may or may not lose consciousness. In tonic-clonic seizures, the muscles become stiff, causing the person to fall. Then the muscles alternately flex and relax. Usually, a tonic-clonic seizure is caused by epilepsy. But sometimes this type of seizure can be triggered by other health problems, such as a high fever or damage to the brain. Some people who have a tonic-clonic seizure don’t have another one and don't need treatment. But someone who has recurrent seizures may need treatment with daily anti-seizure medicines to control and prevent future tonic-clonic seizures. Surgery and dietary changes also may be options to manage your seizures.",

The trachea, also called the windpipe, is the tube that brings air from the mouth and nose to the lungs. Firm rings made of cartilage hold the windpipe open during breathing. Tracheomalacia occurs most often in babies, when the cartilage in the windpipe has not developed as it should. This soft cartilage makes the windpipe floppy, so it's not stiff enough to keep the airway open. Another cause of tracheomalacia is when a blood vessel presses on the windpipe so that it can't open enough with breathing. Less often, tracheomalacia affects older children and adults. Tracheomalacia can be life-threatening and make it difficult to breathe. Trouble breathing can make it hard to be active. Also, the collapse can cause repeated airway and lung infections. Your child may not need treatment if tracheomalacia symptoms are mild. Symptoms sometimes improve on their own as a child grows and the windpipe gets stronger. If symptoms are more serious and limit a child's quality of life, medicine, therapy and surgery can help.",

Trachoma is contagious, spreading through contact with the eyes, eyelids, and nose or throat secretions of infected people. It can also be passed on by handling infected items, such as handkerchiefs. At first, trachoma may cause mild itching and irritation of your eyes and eyelids. Then you may notice swollen eyelids and pus draining from the eyes. Untreated trachoma can lead to blindness. Trachoma is the leading preventable cause of blindness worldwide. Most trachoma cases occur in poor areas of Africa, where 85% of people with active disease reside. In areas where trachoma is prevalent, infection rates among children under 5 can be 60% or more. Early treatment may help prevent trachoma complications.",

The fingers most often affected are the ring finger and the thumb, but the condition can affect any finger. Trigger finger happens when the tendon that controls that finger can't glide smoothly in the sheath that surrounds it. This may occur if part of the tendon sheath becomes swollen or if a small lump forms on the tendon. The condition is most common in women over the age of 50. You may be at higher risk of trigger finger if you have diabetes, low thyroid function or rheumatoid arthritis. Treatment of trigger finger can include splinting, steroid injections or surgery.",

This mixing reduces the amount of oxygen delivered to the body. It usually increases the amount of blood flow into the lungs too. The heart has to work harder to adjust for the changes in blood flow. A baby, also called a fetus, with truncus arteriosus also usually has a hole between the two lower heart chambers, called the ventricles. The hole is called a ventricular septal defect. Another name for truncus arteriosus is common arterial trunk.",

Ulcerative colitis (UL-sur-uh-tiv koe-LIE-tis) affects the innermost lining of the large intestine, called the colon, and rectum. Symptoms usually develop over time, rather than coming on suddenly. Ulcerative colitis can weaken the body and can sometimes lead to life-threatening complications. While it has no known cure, treatment can greatly reduce and relieve symptoms of the disease. It also may bring about long-term remission.",

An undescended testicle is more common in premature babies than it is in full-term infants. An undescended testicle often moves down on its own within a few months after the baby is born.

This condition also may be called V-tach or VT. A healthy heart typically beats about 60 to 100 times a minute at rest. In ventricular tachycardia, the heart beats faster, usually 100 or more beats a minute. Sometimes the rapid heartbeat stops the heart chambers from properly filling with blood. The heart may not be able to pump enough blood to the body. If this happens, you may feel short of breath or lightheaded. Some people lose consciousness. Ventricular tachycardia episodes may be brief and last only a few seconds without causing harm. But episodes lasting more than a few seconds, called sustainedV-tach, can be life-threatening. Sometimes ventricular tachycardia can cause all heart activity to stop. This complication is called sudden cardiac arrest. Treatments for ventricular tachycardia include medicines, a shock to the heart, a heart device, and a procedure or surgery.",

The spine is made up of many small vertebrae stacked on top of one another. The vertebrae hold the body upright. They enclose and protect the spinal cord. Vertebral tumors can be cancerous or not cancerous. A noncancerous vertebral tumor also is called a benign vertebral tumor. Vertebral tumors that are cancerous are called malignant vertebral tumors. Most malignant vertebral tumors are caused by cancer that starts somewhere else in the body and spreads to the spine. Cancer that spreads from an organ to another part of the body is called metastatic cancer. Cancers that affect the blood cells and bone marrow also can cause malignant vertebral tumors. Vertebral tumors that start in the bones of the spine and haven't spread from somewhere else are rare. Another name for these tumors is primary bone tumors. Treatment for vertebral tumors includes surgery, radiation therapy and medicines, including chemotherapy. Small and slow-growing vertebral tumors might not need treatment right away. The treatment that's best for your vertebral tumor depends on your situation. Your healthcare team considers the type of tumor you have, whether it is cancerous and its location within the spine.",

It flows back up tubes called ureters that connect the kidneys to the bladder. Typically, urine flows from the kidneys through the ureters down to the bladder. It's not supposed to flow back up. Most often, vesicoureteral reflux is found in infants and children. Some are born with vesicoureteral reflux due to an issue with the structure of one of the two ureters. Others develop the condition later for reasons such as the bladder not being able to empty fully. With vesicoureteral reflux, urine can carry germs from the bladder up to the kidneys. That raises the risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs).UTIscan happen in any of the organs that make urine and remove it from the body. These infections can cause symptoms such as a strong need to urinate and pain while urinating. Without treatment,UTIscan lead to kidney damage. Some children who are born with vesicoureteral reflux outgrow it. Others need treatment such as medicine or surgery. The goal of treatment is to prevent kidney damage and moreUTIs.",

Vulvar cancer commonly forms as a lump or sore on the vulva that often causes itching. Though it can happen at any age, vulvar cancer is usually diagnosed in older adults. Vulvar cancer treatment often starts with surgery to remove the cancer and a small amount of surrounding healthy tissue. Sometimes vulvar cancer surgery requires removing the entire vulva. The earlier vulvar cancer is diagnosed, the less likely an extensive surgery is needed for treatment.",

Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is considered a type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It's sometimes called lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. In Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, some white blood cells undergo changes that turn them into cancer cells. The cancer cells can build up in the spongy material inside the bones where blood cells are made. This material is called bone marrow. The cancer cells crowd healthy blood cells out of the bone marrow. Cancer cells also may build up in other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes and the spleen. The cancer cells make a protein that can build up in the blood. Too much of the protein can reduce blood flow in the body and cause other problems.",

Copper plays a key role in building healthy nerves, bones, collagen and the skin pigment melanin. You usually take in copper from the food you eat. Your liver produces a substance called bile that removes any extra copper. But in people with Wilson's disease, copper isn't removed properly and instead builds up.

        "Overview": "A vaginal yeast infection is a fungal infection. It causes irritation, discharge and itching of the vagina and the vulva. Vaginal yeast infection also is called vaginal candidiasis. Vaginal yeast infection affects most people assigned female at birth at some point in life. Many have at least two infections. People who don't have sex can get a vaginal yeast infection. So it isn't though of as a sexually transmitted infection. But you can get vaginal yeast infections through sex. There's a higher risk of vaginal yeast infection when you start having sex. And some vaginal yeast infections may be linked to sexual contact between the mouth and genital area, called oral-genital sex. Medicines can treat vaginal yeast infections. Yeast infections that happen four times or more a year may need a longer treatment course and a plan to prevent them.",

        "Causes": [
            "In some people, the yips are a type of focal dystonia, a condition that causes involuntary muscle contractions during a specific task. It's most likely related to overuse of a certain set of muscles, similar to writer's cramp. Anxiety worsens the effect."

        "Overview": "The yips are involuntary wrist spasms that occur most commonly when golfers are trying to putt. However, the yips also can affect people who play other sports — such as cricket, darts and baseball. It was once thought that the yips were always associated with performance anxiety. However, it now appears that some people have the yips due to a neurological condition affecting specific muscles. This condition is known as focal dystonia. Changing the way you perform the affected task might help you find relief from the yips. For example, a right-handed golfer might try putting left-handed.",

        "Overview": "In Zenker's diverticulum, a bulge or pouch forms at the top of the tube that connects the throat to the stomach, called the esophagus. The condition is not common. Connected bands of muscle that work to pass food from the mouth to the stomach make up the esophagus. Over time, the bulge of Zenker's diverticulum can get bigger. Food, pills and even thick mucus can get stuck in the pouch instead of going through the esophagus. This can lead to problems with eating and other complications. The cause of Zenker's diverticulum is not known. It happens most often to men older than 60. Treatment for symptoms of Zenker's diverticulum often is surgery.",

            "The exact cause of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome isn't known. But the pattern of events that occurs in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome typically follows the same sequence. The syndrome begins when one or more tumors form in the pancreas or a part of the small intestine called the duodenum. The duodenum is the section connected to the stomach. Sometimes the tumors form at other sites, such as the lymph nodes next to the pancreas."

        "Complications": [],
        "Prevention": [],
        "Overview": "Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is a condition in which one or more tumors grow in the pancreas or small intestine. The tumors, called gastrinomas, produce large amounts of the hormone gastrin. Gastrin causes the stomach to produce too much acid, which leads to peptic ulcers. High gastrin levels also can cause diarrhea, belly pain and other symptoms. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is rare. Though it may happen at any time in life, people usually find out they have it sometime between ages 20 and 50. Medicines to cut down stomach acid and heal the ulcers are the usual treatment. Some people also may need surgery to remove tumors.",
